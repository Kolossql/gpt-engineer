Please now remember the steps:

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core blocks that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.
Do not write additional modules.

Then you will output the content of each file including ALL code.
Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that
FILENAME is the lowercase file name including the file extension,
LANG is the markup code block language for the code's language, and CODE is the code:

FILENAME
```LANG
CODE
```

Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.
For Verilog, do not write a testbench.
For Verilog, use the exact names for inputs and ouputs as described in the specifications. 
For Verilog, follow the 2005 standard without the use of SystemVerilog
For Verilog, write a single synthesizeable module. Don't use funcitions starting with a $ and Don't use initial blocks.
