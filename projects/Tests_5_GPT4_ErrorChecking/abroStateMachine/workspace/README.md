The necessary blocks for the testbench are:

- Initialization block: This block will initialize the inputs and outputs of the ABROStateMachine module and set the initial conditions for the testbench.
- Stimulus block: This block will provide the necessary inputs to the ABROStateMachine module and simulate the different scenarios that need to be tested.
- Monitor block: This block will monitor the outputs of the ABROStateMachine module and compare them with the expected outputs to determine if the test passed or failed.

The important edge cases to test are:

- Case when both A and B inputs are received at the same time.
- Case when A input is received before B input.
- Case when B input is received before A input.
- Case when the reset signal is triggered while the state machine is in the middle of transitioning between states.
- Case when the clock signal changes while the state machine is in the middle of transitioning between states.

The content of the testbench module is as follows:

testbench.v
