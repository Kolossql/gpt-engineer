The error message indicates that the `binary_input` is being used in a constant expression, which is not allowed in Verilog. This is happening because the `binary_input` is being assigned to the `shift_register` at the time of declaration, which is not allowed. The `shift_register` should be assigned inside an `always` block.

Here is the corrected code for the BinaryToBCD module:

binarytobcd.v
