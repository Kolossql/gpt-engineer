Looking at the output, it seems that Test Cases 2, 3, and 4 have failed. Let's review the code for these test cases and identify the issues.

Test Case 2: Shift in a 0
In this test case, we are shifting in a 0 while the shift_enable is high. The expected output is 0, but the test case has failed. This could be because we are checking the output immediately after changing the input. The output will only change on the next rising edge of the clock. We should wait for a clock cycle before checking the output.

Test Case 3: Disable shift
In this test case, we are disabling the shift (shift_enable = 0) and then changing the input to 1. The expected output is 0, but the test case has failed. This could be because we are checking the output immediately after changing the input and shift_enable. We should wait for a clock cycle before checking the output.

Test Case 4: Enable shift with clock low
In this test case, we are enabling the shift with the clock low. The expected output is 0, but the test case has failed. This could be because we are checking the output immediately after changing the clock and shift_enable. We should wait for a clock cycle before checking the output.

Here is the corrected testbench code:
