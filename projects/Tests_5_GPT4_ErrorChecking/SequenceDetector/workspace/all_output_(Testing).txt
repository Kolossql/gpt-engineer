The error messages indicate that there are syntax errors on lines 9 and 10 of the sequencedetector.v file. The error messages suggest that there is an issue with the module instantiation. 

Looking at the code, it seems that the issue is with the use of the `typedef` keyword. In Verilog 2001, `typedef` is not a valid keyword. It was introduced in SystemVerilog. 

To fix this, we can replace the `typedef` and `enum` with a `parameter` declaration. Here is the corrected code:

sequencedetector.v
```verilog
module SequenceDetector (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset_n,
    input wire [2:0] data_in,
    output reg sequence_found
);

    // Define the states
    parameter S0 = 0, S1 = 1, S2 = 2, S3 = 3, S4 = 4, S5 = 5, S6 = 6, S7 = 7, S8 = 8;
    reg [3:0] current_state, next_state;

    // State Machine
    always @(posedge clk or negedge reset_n) begin
        if (!reset_n)
            current_state <= S0;
        else
            current_state <= next_state;
    end

    // Sequence Detector
    always @(current_state or data_in) begin
        case (current_state)
            S0: if (data_in == 3'b001) next_state = S1; else next_state = S0;
            S1: if (data_in == 3'b101) next_state = S2; else next_state = S0;
            S2: if (data_in == 3'b110) next_state = S3; else next_state = S0;
            S3: if (data_in == 3'b000) next_state = S4; else next_state = S0;
            S4: if (data_in == 3'b110) next_state = S5; else next_state = S0;
            S5: if (data_in == 3'b110) next_state = S6; else next_state = S0;
            S6: if (data_in == 3'b011) next_state = S7; else next_state = S0;
            S7: if (data_in == 3'b101) next_state = S8; else next_state = S0;
            S8: next_state = S0;
            default: next_state = S0;
        endcase
    end

    // Output Register
    always @(current_state) begin
        if (current_state == S8)
            sequence_found <= 1;
        else
            sequence_found <= 0;
    end

endmodule
```
This code should now be compatible with Verilog 2001.
