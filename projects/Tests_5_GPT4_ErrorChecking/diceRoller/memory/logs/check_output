Test Cases: This block will contain the different test cases to verify the functionality of the DiceRoller module.\n3. Verification: This block will check the output of the DiceRoller module and display whether the test case passed or failed.\n\nEdge cases to test:\n\n1. Roll input stays high for more than one clock cycle.\n2. Roll input goes high at the same time as the clock rising edge.\n3. Die select changes while the roll input is high.\n4. Active-low reset goes high.\n5. Die select input is not in the specified range (00, 01, 10, 11).\n\nNow, let's write the testbench module.\n\ntestbench.v\n```verilog\n`timescale 1ns / 1ps\n\nmodule DiceRoller_tb;\n    reg clk;\n    reg reset_n;\n    reg [1:0] die_select;\n    reg roll;\n    wire [7:0] rolled_number;\n\n    DiceRoller u1 (\n        .clk(clk), \n        .reset_n(reset_n), \n        .die_select(die_select), \n        .roll(roll), \n        .rolled_number(rolled_number)\n    );\n\n    initial begin\n        $dumpfile(\"WaveOutput.vcd\");\n        $dumpvars(0, DiceRoller_tb);\n\n        // Initialize inputs\n        clk = 0;\n        reset_n = 0;\n        die_select = 2'b00;\n        roll = 0;\n\n        // Test Cases\n        #10 reset_n = 1; // Active-low reset goes high\n        #10 die_select = 2'b01; roll = 1; // Roll 6-sided die\n        #20 roll = 0; // Roll input stays high for more than one clock cycle\n        #10 roll = 1; // Roll input goes high at the same time as the clock rising edge\n        #10 die_select = 2'b10; // Die select changes while the roll input is high\n        #10 die_select = 2'b11; roll = 0; // Die select input is not in the specified range\n        #10 $finish;\n    end\n\n    always #5 clk = ~clk;\n\n    initial begin\n        // Verification\n        #10 if (rolled_number >= 1 && rolled_number <= 4) $display(\"Test 1 Passed\");\n            else $display(\"Test 1 Failed\");\n        #20 if (rolled_number >= 1 && rolled_number <= 6) $display(\"Test 2 Passed\");\n            else $display(\"Test 2 Failed\");\n        #10 if (rolled_number >= 1 && rolled_number <= 6) $display(\"Test 3 Passed\");\n            else $display(\"Test 3 Failed\");\n        #10 if (rolled_number >= 1 && rolled_number <= 8) $display(\"Test 4 Passed\");\n            else $display(\"Test 4 Failed\");\n        #10 if (rolled_number >= 1 && rolled_number <= 20) $display(\"Test 5 Passed\");\n            else $display(\"Test 5 Failed\");\n    end\nendmodule\n```\nThis testbench module initializes the DiceRoller module and runs five test cases, each corresponding to one of the edge cases. It then verifies the output of the DiceRoller module and displays whether each test case passed or failed. The waveforms of the simulation are dumped into a .vcd file for viewing in gtkwave.",

The testbench is expecting the rolled_number to be between 1 and 4 after the reset is deactivated, but it seems that this is not the case.\n\nThe issue might be due to the fact that the roll signal is not activated after the reset is deactivated. The DiceRoller module only updates the rolled_number when the roll signal is high. Therefore, we need to set the roll signal high after the reset is deactivated.\n\nHere is the corrected testbench:\n\ntestbench.v\n```verilog\n`timescale 1ns / 1ps\n\nmodule DiceRoller_tb;\n    reg clk;\n    reg reset_n;\n    reg [1:0] die_select;\n    reg roll;\n    wire [7:0] rolled_number;\n\n    DiceRoller u1 (\n        .clk(clk), \n        .reset_n(reset_n), \n        .die_select(die_select), \n        .roll(roll), \n        .rolled_number(rolled_number)\n    );\n\n    initial begin\n        $dumpfile(\"WaveOutput.vcd\");\n        $dumpvars(0, DiceRoller_tb);\n\n        // Initialize inputs\n        clk = 0;\n        reset_n = 0;\n        die_select = 2'b00;\n        roll = 0;\n\n        // Test Cases\n        #10 reset_n = 1; roll = 1; // Active-low reset goes high and roll 4-sided die\n        #10 die_select = 2'b01; // Roll 6-sided die\n        #20 roll = 0; // Roll input stays high for more than one clock cycle\n        #10 roll = 1; // Roll input goes high at the same time as the clock rising edge\n        #10 die_select = 2'b10; // Die select changes while the roll input is high\n        #10 die_select = 2'b11; roll = 0; // Die select input is not in the specified range\n        #10 $finish;\n    end\n\n    always #5 clk = ~clk;\n\n    initial begin\n        // Verification\n        #20 if (rolled_number >= 1 && rolled_number <= 4) $display(\"Test 1 Passed\");\n            else $display(\"Test 1 Failed\");\n        #20 if (rolled_number >= 1 && rolled_number <= 6) $display(\"Test 2 Passed\");\n            else $display(\"Test 2 Failed\");\n        #10 if (rolled_number >= 1 && rolled_number <= 6) $display(\"Test 3 Passed\");\n            else $display(\"Test 3 Failed\");\n        #10 if (rolled_number >= 1 && rolled_number <= 8) $display(\"Test 4 Passed\");\n            else $display(\"Test 4 Failed\");\n        #10 if (rolled_number >= 1 && rolled_number <= 20) $display(\"Test 5 Passed\");\n            else $display(\"Test 5 Failed\");\n    end\nendmodule\n```\nThis should fix the issue with Test 1 and make all tests pass.",
