Looking at the output, it seems that Test Case 2 has failed. This test case is supposed to check the behavior of the SequenceGenerator when the active-low reset signal is triggered while the sequence is being outputted. The expected behavior, as per our assumptions, is that the SequenceGenerator should immediately reset to the initial state, regardless of the enable signal or the clock state.

Upon reviewing the testbench code, it appears that the issue lies in the timing of the signals. The reset_n signal is asserted low at time 40, but the enable signal is not asserted high until time 50. This means that the SequenceGenerator is not in the middle of outputting the sequence when the reset_n signal is triggered, which is not the intended scenario for this test case.

To fix this, we need to adjust the timing of the signals in Test Case 2. The enable signal should be asserted high before the reset_n signal is triggered. Here is the corrected testbench code:

testbench.v
```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module SequenceGenerator_tb;

    // Inputs
    reg clk;
    reg reset_n;
    reg enable;

    // Outputs
    wire [7:0] data;

    // Instantiate the Unit Under Test (UUT)
    SequenceGenerator uut (
        .clk(clk), 
        .reset_n(reset_n), 
        .enable(enable), 
        .data(data)
    );

    initial begin
        // Initialize Inputs
        clk = 0;
        reset_n = 0;
        enable = 0;

        // Dump waveforms
        $dumpfile("WaveOutput.vcd");
        $dumpvars(0, SequenceGenerator_tb);

        // Test Case 1: Toggle enable while sequence is being outputted
        #10 enable = 1;
        #10 enable = 0;
        #10 enable = 1;
        if (data == 8'hAF) $display("Test Case 1: Passed");
        else $display("Test Case 1: Failed");

        // Test Case 2: Trigger active-low reset while sequence is being outputted
        #10 enable = 1;
        #10 reset_n = 1;
        #10 reset_n = 0;
        if (data == 8'hAF) $display("Test Case 2: Passed");
        else $display("Test Case 2: Failed");

        // Test Case 3: Clock has a rising edge but enable is not high
        #10 clk = 1;
        #10 clk = 0;
        if (data == 8'hAF) $display("Test Case 3: Passed");
        else $display("Test Case 3: Failed");

        // Test Case 4: Sequence ends
        #80 enable = 1;
        if (data == 8'hAF) $display("Test Case 4: Passed");
        else $display("Test Case 4: Failed");

        // Test Case 5: Initial state
        #10 reset_n = 1;
        if (data == 8'hAF) $display("Test Case 5: Passed");
        else $display("Test Case 5: Failed");

        // End of tests
        $finish;
    end

    // Clock generator
    always #5 clk = ~clk;

endmodule
```
This corrected testbench should now pass all test cases.
