The error message indicates that the `data` output, which is declared as `reg`, cannot be driven by primitives or continuous assignment. In Verilog, only `wire` types can be driven by continuous assignments or gate primitives. 

To fix this error, we need to change the `data` output declaration from `reg` to `wire` in the LFSR module. Here is the corrected code:

lfsr.v
