Looking at the output, it seems like the first three tests have failed. These tests are checking the transition of the traffic light from red to green, green to yellow, and yellow to red. The issue here is that the state machine is not taking into account the number of clock cycles that each light should be on for. 

In the original specifications, it was stated that the red light should be on for 32 clock cycles, the green light for 20 clock cycles, and the yellow light for 7 clock cycles. However, in the current implementation, the state machine transitions to the next state in every clock cycle when the 'enable' signal is high. 

To fix this, we need to add a counter that will count the number of clock cycles and only allow the state to change when the counter reaches the specified number of clock cycles for each light. 

Here is the corrected code:

trafficlightstatemachine.v
