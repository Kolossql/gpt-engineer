This ensures that the simulation terminates correctly.\n\nPlease note that the testbench code assumes that the `SequenceGenerator` module is defined in a separate file named `SequenceGenerator.v` and has been properly implemented.\n\nTo run the simulation, you can use a Verilog simulator such as ModelSim or Icarus Verilog. After running the simulation, you can check the console output for the test results. Additionally, the waveform file `WaveOutput.vcd` can be opened in a waveform viewer like GTKWave to visualize the waveform and verify the behavior of the module.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.",
