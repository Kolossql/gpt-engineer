I am trying to create a Behavioral Verilog module for a shift register. It must meet the following specifications:
Initial State: stored data at 00000000
Inputs:
Clock: On the clock rising edge if Shift enable is high shift the Data bit on the right side of the data vector
Active-low reset: resets the module to the initial state
Data (1 bit): The data bit that is next to be shifted
Shift enable: On the clock rising edge if Shift enable is high shift the Data bit on the right side of the data vector
Outputs:
Data (8 bits): Outputs the stored data when the data is changed
