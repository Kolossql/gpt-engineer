The necessary blocks for testing the sequence generator module are:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the sequence generator module and provide the necessary inputs for testing.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This block will generate the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Enable generator: This block will generate the enable signal for the testbench module.
5. Monitor: This block will monitor the output of the sequence generator module and check if it produces the expected sequence.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Testing the initial state of the sequence generator module.
2. Testing the sequence generation when the enable signal is low.
3. Testing the sequence generation when the enable signal is high.
4. Testing the sequence generation with different clock frequencies.
5. Testing the sequence generation with different reset timings.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:

**sequence_generator_tb.v**
