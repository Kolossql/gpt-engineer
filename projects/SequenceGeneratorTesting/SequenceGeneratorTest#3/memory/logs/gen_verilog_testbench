The initial state of the sequence generator module.\n2. The sequence generation when the enable signal is low.\n3. The sequence generation when the enable signal is high.\n4. The sequence generation with different clock frequencies.\n5. The sequence generation with different reset timings.\n\nThe testbench module generates the clock signal, active-low reset signal, and enable signal. It monitors the output of the sequence generator module and displays the data value. The test cases are executed with specific delays to simulate different scenarios. Finally, the simulation is finished after a certain period of time.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."}]
