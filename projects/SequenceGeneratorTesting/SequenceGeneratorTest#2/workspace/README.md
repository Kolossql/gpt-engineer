The core module for the sequence generator will be named "sequence_generator". It will have the following blocks:
1. Clock Divider: Divides the clock signal to generate a slower clock for sequence generation.
2. Sequence Counter: Keeps track of the current position in the sequence.
3. Output Logic: Generates the output sequence based on the current position.

Now I will provide the content of each file, starting with the entrypoint file "sequence_generator.v".

sequence_generator.v
