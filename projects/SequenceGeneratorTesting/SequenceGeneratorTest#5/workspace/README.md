The necessary blocks for testing the sequence generator module are as follows:

1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the sequence generator module and provide the necessary inputs (clock, reset, enable) and monitor the outputs (data). It will also generate the test stimuli and verify the expected outputs.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:

1. Test the initial state: Verify that the output data is the first element of the sequence (0xAF) when the module is reset.
2. Test the sequence generation: Verify that the output data follows the specified sequence when the enable signal is high and the clock signal has rising edges.
3. Test the enable signal: Verify that the output data remains unchanged when the enable signal is low.
4. Test the active-low reset: Verify that the module resets to the initial state (outputting 0xAF) when the reset signal goes low.
5. Test the continuous sequence generation: Verify that the output data repeats the sequence indefinitely.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:
