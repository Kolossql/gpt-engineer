SequenceGenerator: This module generates the output sequence based on the clock, active-low reset, and enable signals.\n\nNow, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.\n\n1. sequence_generator.v: (Entrypoint file)\n\n```verilog\nmodule sequence_generator (\n  input wire clk,\n  input wire rst_n,\n  input wire enable,\n  output reg [7:0] data\n);\n\n  // Internal state variables\n  reg [2:0] state;\n  \n  // Sequence values\n  parameter [7:0] SEQUENCE [0:7] = '{8'hAF, 8'hBC, 8'hE2, 8'h78, 8'hFF, 8'hE2, 8'h0B, 8'h8D};\n  \n  // Output data assignment\n  always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin\n    if (~rst_n) begin\n      data <= SEQUENCE[0];\n      state <= 0;\n    end else if (enable) begin\n      case (state)\n        0: begin\n          data <= SEQUENCE[0];\n          state <= 1;\n        end\n        1: begin\n          data <= SEQUENCE[1];\n          state <= 2;\n        end\n        2: begin\n          data <= SEQUENCE[2];\n          state <= 3;\n        end\n        3: begin\n          data <= SEQUENCE[3];\n          state <= 4;\n        end\n        4: begin\n          data <= SEQUENCE[4];\n          state <= 5;\n        end\n        5: begin\n          data <= SEQUENCE[5];\n          state <= 6;\n        end\n        6: begin\n          data <= SEQUENCE[6];\n          state <= 7;\n        end\n        7: begin\n          data <= SEQUENCE[7];\n          state <= 0;\n        end\n        default: begin\n          data <= SEQUENCE[0];\n          state <= 0;\n        end\n      endcase\n    end\n  end\n\nendmodule\n```\n\nThis completes the implementation of the sequence generator module. The module takes inputs `clk`, `rst_n`, and `enable`, and outputs `data`. The internal state variable `state` is used to keep track of the current state of the sequence generator. The output `data` is updated based on the current state and the enable signal. The sequence values are defined as a parameter array `SEQUENCE`, and the output data is assigned accordingly in each state.\n\nThe module follows the assumptions made earlier, such as updating the output data on the rising edge of the clock signal and immediately updating the output data when the enable signal goes high.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance."}]
