We have also generated the clock signal using a clock generator block. The stimulus generator block is used to generate the necessary stimulus signals (active-low reset, enable) for testing different scenarios. The expected output generator block generates the expected output sequence based on the specified behavior of the sequence generator module.\n\nThe output data is monitored in the always block, and if the enable signal is high, it compares the output data with the expected values. If there is a mismatch, it displays an error message.\n\nFinally, we dump the waveform to a VCD file using the $dumpfile and $dumpvars system tasks.\n\nPlease note that the code provided is a complete testbench module that tests the sequence generator module for the specified cases and edge cases.",
