The blocks necessary to properly test the module are:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the sequence generator module and provide the necessary inputs (clock, active-low reset, enable) for testing. It will also monitor the output data and compare it with the expected values.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Stimulus generator: This block will generate the necessary stimulus signals (active-low reset, enable) for testing different scenarios.
4. Expected output generator: This block will generate the expected output sequence based on the specified behavior of the sequence generator module.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Test the initial state of the module, where it should output the first element of the sequence immediately upon power-up.
2. Test the behavior of the module when the active-low reset signal is asserted.
3. Test the behavior of the module when the enable signal is low.
4. Test the sequence generation when the clock signal has a rising edge.
5. Test the sequence generation for multiple cycles to ensure it repeats correctly.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:
