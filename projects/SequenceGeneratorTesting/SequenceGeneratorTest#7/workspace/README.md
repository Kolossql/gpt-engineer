The necessary blocks for testing the sequence generator module are:
1. Testbench module: This module instantiates the sequence generator module and provides the necessary inputs (clock, reset, enable) for testing. It also monitors the output of the sequence generator and verifies its correctness.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Clock edge case: Test the behavior of the sequence generator when the clock signal has a rising edge.
2. Active-low reset edge case: Test the behavior of the sequence generator when the active-low reset signal is asserted.
3. Enable edge case: Test the behavior of the sequence generator when the enable signal is high or low.
4. Sequence repetition: Test the behavior of the sequence generator when it reaches the end of the sequence and starts generating it again.
5. Data output verification: Verify that the data output of the sequence generator matches the expected sequence values.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:

testbench.v
