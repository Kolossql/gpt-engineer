SequenceGenerator: This block generates the output sequence based on the clock, active-low reset, and enable signals.\n\nNow let's proceed with the code implementation.\n\n**sequence_generator.v**\n```verilog\nmodule SequenceGenerator (\n  input wire clk,\n  input wire reset,\n  input wire enable,\n  output reg [7:0] data\n);\n\n  // Internal state variable to keep track of the current sequence index\n  reg [2:0] sequenceIndex;\n\n  // Sequence values\n  reg [7:0] sequence [7:0] = {8'hAF, 8'hBC, 8'hE2, 8'h78, 8'hFF, 8'hE2, 8'h0B, 8'h8D};\n\n  always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin\n    if (reset == 1'b0) begin\n      // Reset the sequence index and output the first element of the sequence\n      sequenceIndex <= 3'b000;\n      data <= sequence[0];\n    end else if (enable == 1'b1) begin\n      // Increment the sequence index and output the corresponding sequence element\n      sequenceIndex <= sequenceIndex + 1;\n      data <= sequence[sequenceIndex];\n    end\n  end\n\nendmodule\n```\n\nIn the above code, we have implemented the `SequenceGenerator` module. It takes inputs `clk`, `reset`, and `enable`, and outputs `data`. The module uses a `sequenceIndex` variable to keep track of the current index in the sequence. The `sequence` array holds the hexadecimal values of the sequence elements. Inside the `always` block, we check for the rising edge of the clock and the active-low reset signal. If the reset signal is asserted, we reset the sequence index to 0 and output the first element of the sequence. If the enable signal is high, we increment the sequence index and output the corresponding sequence element.\n\nNow let's move on to the entrypoint file.\n\n**main.v**\n```verilog\nmodule main;\n  \n  // Inputs\n  reg clk;\n  reg reset;\n  reg enable;\n\n  // Outputs\n  wire [7:0] data;\n\n  // Instantiate the SequenceGenerator module\n  SequenceGenerator sequenceGenerator (\n    .clk(clk),\n    .reset(reset),\n    .enable(enable),\n    .data(data)\n  );\n\n  // Clock generation\n  always begin\n    #5 clk = ~clk;\n  end\n\n  // Initial values\n  initial begin\n    clk = 0;\n    reset = 1;\n    enable = 0;\n    #10 reset = 0;\n    #10 enable = 1;\n  end\n\nendmodule\n```\n\nIn the above code, we have the `main` module which serves as the entrypoint for the design. It instantiates the `SequenceGenerator` module and connects its inputs and outputs. We also have a clock generation block that toggles the `clk` signal every 5 time units. The initial block sets the initial values of `clk`, `reset`, and `enable`. After a delay of 10 time units, the reset signal is deasserted, and after another delay of 10 time units, the enable signal is asserted.\n\nThis completes the implementation of the sequence generator module and the entrypoint file. The `sequence_generator.v` file contains the `SequenceGenerator` module, and the `main.v` file serves as the entrypoint for the design.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
