The blocks necessary for testing the SequenceGenerator module are:
1. Clock generator: To generate the clock signal for the testbench.
2. Reset generator: To generate the active-low reset signal for the testbench.
3. Enable generator: To generate the enable signal for the testbench.
4. Data checker: To compare the output data from the SequenceGenerator module with the expected values and display the test results.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Test with the clock signal at different frequencies.
2. Test with the active-low reset signal asserted and de-asserted.
3. Test with the enable signal asserted and de-asserted.
4. Test with the enable signal asserted and the active-low reset signal asserted simultaneously.
5. Test with the enable signal de-asserted and the active-low reset signal asserted simultaneously.
