It outputs the data signal (data) which represents the current value in the sequence.\n\nThe module uses a state machine to control the generation of the sequence. The state machine has two states: IDLE and OUTPUT_SEQUENCE. In the IDLE state, the module waits for the enable signal to be high. Once the enable signal is high, the module transitions to the OUTPUT_SEQUENCE state and starts outputting the sequence values. If the enable signal goes low, the module transitions back to the IDLE state.\n\nThe sequence values are stored in the SEQUENCE_VALUES parameter, which is an array of 8-bit values. The output_data register holds the current value in the sequence and is updated based on the state and enable signal.\n\nThe output_data is assigned to the data output using the assign statement.\n\nThis Verilog code follows the 2005 standard without the use of SystemVerilog and is synthesizable for an ASIC target.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
