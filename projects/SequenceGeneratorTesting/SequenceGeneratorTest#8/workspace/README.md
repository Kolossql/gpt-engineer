The blocks necessary to properly test the module are:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the sequence generator module and provide the necessary inputs (clock, active-low reset, enable) for testing. It will also monitor the data output and verify its correctness.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Test the initial state of the module, where it should output the first element of the sequence immediately upon power-up.
2. Test the behavior of the module when the active-low reset signal is activated.
3. Test the behavior of the module when the enable signal is low.
4. Test the sequence generation by verifying the output for a few cycles.
5. Test the sequence repetition by verifying the output for multiple cycles.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:

testbench.v
