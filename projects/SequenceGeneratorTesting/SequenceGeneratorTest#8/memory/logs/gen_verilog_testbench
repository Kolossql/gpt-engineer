Initial state: It verifies that the module outputs the first element of the sequence immediately upon power-up.\n2. Active-Low Reset: It verifies that the module resets to the initial state when the active-low reset signal is activated.\n3. Enable Signal Low: It verifies that the module does not output the sequence when the enable signal is low.\n4. Sequence Generation: It verifies the correct generation of the sequence by checking the output for a few cycles.\n5. Sequence Repetition: It verifies that the module repeats the sequence by checking the output for multiple cycles.\n\nThe testbench uses display statements to print the expected and actual outputs for each test case. The simulation is stopped after 100 time units using the $finish system function.\n\nPlease note that the testbench assumes a clock period of 10 ns (CLK_PERIOD) and generates a clock signal with a 50% duty cycle. Adjust the CLK_PERIOD value according to your desired clock frequency.",
