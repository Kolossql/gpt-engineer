The necessary blocks for testing the sequence generator module are as follows:

1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the sequence generator module and provide the necessary inputs (clock, reset, enable) for testing. It will also monitor the output data and verify if it matches the expected sequence.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:

1. Test with enable signal low: Verify that the output data remains unchanged when the enable signal is low.
2. Test with active-low reset signal: Verify that the output data returns to the initial state when the reset signal is asserted.
3. Test with clock signal at different frequencies: Verify that the output data changes at the rising edge of the clock signal, regardless of the clock frequency.
4. Test with enable signal high: Verify that the output data follows the expected sequence when the enable signal is high.
5. Test with multiple clock cycles: Verify that the output data changes at each rising edge of the clock signal, generating the sequence correctly over multiple clock cycles.

Now, let's proceed with the code for the testbench module:

testbench.v
