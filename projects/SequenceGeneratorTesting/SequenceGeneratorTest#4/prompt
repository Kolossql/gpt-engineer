I am trying to create a Verilog module for a sequence generator. It must meet the following specifications:
Initial state: outputting the first element of the sequence.
Inputs: 
Clock: When the clock has a rising edge the sequence generator should output the next part of the sequence. This is the only time that 
Active-low reset: The active-low reset should set the module to the initial state.
Enable: The sequence should only be outputted if enable is high.
Outputs: Data (8 bits), Hexadecimal format of the values below.
While enabled, it should generate an output sequence of the following hexadecimal values in the following order and then repeat:
        - 0xAF
        - 0xBC
        - 0xE2
        - 0x78
        - 0xFF
        - 0xE2
        - 0x0B
        - 0x8D
