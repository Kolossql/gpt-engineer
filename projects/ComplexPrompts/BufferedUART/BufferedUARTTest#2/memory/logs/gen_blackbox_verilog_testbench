The fastest\n    rate is the core clock frequency divided by 8.  All register\n    values less than 8 can be treated as the same as divide-by-8.\n    Only the receive function of the UART needs to be implemented.\n(2) The UART is connected to one input GPIO.  Use caravel GPIO[5]\n    for Rx (receive), which matches the function of that pin for the\n    management SoC.\n(3) There is a dual-port memory of 1kB that holds (buffers) any\n    input data until they are read by the SoC.  The memory will be\n    one of the SRAM macros, so there is a defined module function\n    and pinout for it.\n(4) There is a small memory controller that maintains two pointers\n    (addresses) to the SRAM, one for the bottom of the buffer\n    (oldest data) and one for the top of the buffer (newest data).\n    The initial pointer values (addresses) for the buffer top and\n    bottom are both zero.\n(5) There is a wishbone interface to the caravel SoC.  It decodes\n    five different addresses for these registered values:\n        (1) Input data word (read only) (from SRAM read-only port,\n            the buffer bottom)\n        (2) A configuration word for controlling the UART (enable\n            and baud rate) (read/write)\n        (3) Buffer status (empty, full, near empty, near full,\n            overflow, underflow)\n        (4) Buffer address top (read only) (diagnostic)\n        (5) Buffer address bottom (read only) (diagnostic)\n    The wishbone address for the user project space is 0x30000000.\n    The interface implementation needs only to look at the low byte\n    to decode the five registers above.\n(5) When the UART receives a byte, it signals to the controller that\n    a byte has been received.  The controller writes the byte to\n    SRAM and increments the address of the top of the buffer.  If the\n    address reaches the end of memory, it loops back to the beginning.\n    If the buffer top equals the buffer bottom, then the \"full\" status\n    is set.  If the buffer top is 10 bytes or less below the buffer\n    bottom, the \"almost full\" status is set.  If the buffer is full\n    when a new UART byte arrives, then it is discarded and the memory\n    pointer is not incremented, and the \"overflow\" status is set.\n(7) The controller always outputs the SRAM value at the bottom of the\n    buffer which can be read on wishbone address 0.  When a read is\n    requested on the wishbone bus at address 0, the controller\n    acknowledges the read and then increments the pointer to the\n    bottom of the buffer.  If the address reaches the end of memory,\n    it loops back to the beginning.  If the buffer top equals the\n    buffer bottom, then the \"empty\" status is set.  If the buffer\n    top is 10 bytes or less above the buffer bottom, the \"almost\n    empty\" status is set.  If the buffer is empty when a new read\n    is requested, then the memory pointer is not decremented, and\n    the \"underflow\" status is set.\nThe SRAM is module sky130_sram_1kbyte_1rw1r_8x1024_8.v from the\nsky130_sram_macros library.
