The necessary blocks for testing the module are:

1. Initialization Block: This block will initialize the inputs and outputs of the module to their default states.
2. Baud Rate Test Block: This block will test the functionality of the baud rate selection feature of the UART.
3. Buffer Test Block: This block will test the functionality of the buffer, including the handling of overflow and underflow conditions.
4. Wishbone Interface Test Block: This block will test the functionality of the wishbone interface, including the decoding of the five different addresses.
5. UART Receive Test Block: This block will test the functionality of the UART's receive feature.

Important edge cases to test:

1. Baud rate selection with a register value less than 8.
2. Buffer overflow condition when a new UART byte arrives.
3. Buffer underflow condition when a new read is requested.
4. Decoding of the five different addresses in the wishbone interface.
5. Reception of a byte in the UART.
