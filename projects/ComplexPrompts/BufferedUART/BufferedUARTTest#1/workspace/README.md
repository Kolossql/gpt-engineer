Blocks necessary for testing:

1. Clock Generator: This block will generate a clock signal for the testbench.
2. Reset Generator: This block will generate a reset signal for the testbench.
3. Input Stimulus: This block will generate the input signals for the testbench.
4. Output Checker: This block will check the output signals of the testbench against the expected values.

Edge cases to test:

1. Baud rate selection: Test the UART with the minimum, maximum, and a few random baud rates.
2. Buffer status: Test the buffer when it is empty, full, near empty, near full, and at random fill levels.
3. Overflow and underflow: Test the behavior of the system when the buffer overflows and underflows.
4. Wishbone interface: Test the wishbone interface by reading and writing to the SRAM and controlling the UART.
5. Memory controller: Test the memory controller by checking the buffer top and bottom pointers.
