The module takes an 8-bit binary input and converts it to a 12-bit BCD output using the Double Dabble algorithm. The conversion is performed on the rising edge of the clock signal. The internal registers `shift_register`, `digit_counter`, and `bcd_digit` are used to store intermediate values during the conversion process. The BCD output is updated for each digit of the BCD representation.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
