The blocks necessary to properly test the binary to BCD converter module are:
1. Binary to BCD Converter Module: This is the module that needs to be tested. It takes a 5-bit binary input and converts it to an 8-bit BCD output.
2. Testbench Module: This module is responsible for generating the test inputs, applying them to the binary to BCD converter module, and verifying the correctness of the output.

Important edge cases to be tested in the testbench:
1. Minimum input value (0 in binary) should result in BCD output of 00000000.
2. Maximum input value (255 in binary) should result in BCD output of 00101001.
3. Input value with all bits set to 1 (31 in binary) should result in BCD output of 00001111.
4. Input value with all bits set to 0 (0 in binary) should result in BCD output of 00000000.
5. Random input value (e.g., 11010 in binary) should result in the corresponding BCD output.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:

**testbench.v**
