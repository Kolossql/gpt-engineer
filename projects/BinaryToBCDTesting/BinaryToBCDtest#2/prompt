I am trying to create a Behavioral Verilog module for a binary to binary-coded-decimal converter. Use an efficient algorithm to compute the conversion. It must meet the following specifications:
Inputs:
Binary input (8-bits): Binary number between 0-255
Outputs:
BCD (12-bits): 4-bits for the 10's place and 4-bits for the 1's place
