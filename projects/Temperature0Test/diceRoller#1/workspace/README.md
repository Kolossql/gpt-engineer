The necessary blocks for testing the module are:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the module under test and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs and verify their correctness.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This block will generate the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Stimulus generator: This block will generate the necessary stimulus for the inputs of the module under test.
5. Monitor: This block will monitor the outputs of the module under test and display them for verification.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Testing the roll input when it is low.
2. Testing the roll input when it is high but the clock rising edge does not occur.
3. Testing the roll input when it is high and the clock rising edge occurs.
4. Testing the active-low reset signal.
5. Testing different die select values to simulate rolling different types of dice.

Now let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:

**testbench.v**
