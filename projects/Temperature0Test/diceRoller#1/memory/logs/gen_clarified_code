It takes inputs `clk`, `reset`, `die_select`, and `roll`, and outputs `rolled_number`. The module includes internal registers `current_die_select` and `current_rolled_number` to keep track of the current state.\n\nThe initial state is set in the `initial` block, where `current_die_select` is initialized to 2'b00 and `current_rolled_number` is initialized to 8'b00000000.\n\nThe roll logic is implemented in the `always` block with sensitivity to the rising edge of `clk` and the rising edge of `reset`. If `reset` is high, the module is reset to its initial state. If `roll` is high and the selected die is different from the current die, the `current_die_select` is updated and the `current_rolled_number` is assigned based on the selected die using a case statement.\n\nThe output assignment is implemented in another `always` block with sensitivity to the rising edge of `clk`. If `reset` is high, the `rolled_number` is set to 8'b00000000. Otherwise, the `rolled_number` is assigned the value of `current_rolled_number`.\n\nThis completes the implementation of the `DiceRoller` module.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
