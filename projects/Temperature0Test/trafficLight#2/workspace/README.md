The necessary blocks for testing the traffic light module are as follows:

1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the traffic light module and provide the necessary inputs for testing.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This block will generate the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Enable generator: This block will generate the enable signal for the testbench module.
5. Monitor: This block will monitor the outputs of the traffic light module and display the results.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Verify that the traffic light module starts in the correct initial state (red light with 32 clock cycles remaining before green).
2. Transition from red to green: Verify that the traffic light module transitions from red to green after 32 clock cycles.
3. Transition from green to yellow: Verify that the traffic light module transitions from green to yellow after 20 clock cycles.
4. Transition from yellow to red: Verify that the traffic light module transitions from yellow to red after 7 clock cycles.
5. Reset behavior: Verify that the traffic light module resets to the initial state after reaching the end of its cycle.

Now, let's proceed with the code for the testbench module.
