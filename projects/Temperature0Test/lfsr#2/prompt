I am trying to create a Verilog model for an LFSR. It must meet the following specifications:
Initial state: should be 10001010, and the taps should be at locations 1, 4, 6, and 7.
Inputs:
Clock: On every clock rising edge output the psuedo random number
Active-low reset: reset the module to the initial state
Outputs:
Data (8-bits): The psuedorandom output of the LFSR module
