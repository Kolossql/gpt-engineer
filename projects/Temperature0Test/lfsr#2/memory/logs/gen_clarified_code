LFSR_tb: Testbench module for the LFSR module.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the code implementation.\n\nlfsr.v\n```verilog\nmodule lfsr (\n  input wire clk,\n  input wire reset,\n  output wire [7:0] data\n);\n\n  reg [7:0] state;\n\n  always @(posedge clk or negedge reset) begin\n    if (!reset) begin\n      state <= 8'b10001010;\n    end else begin\n      state <= {state[6:0], state[7] ^ state[6] ^ state[3] ^ state[1]};\n    end\n  end\n\n  assign data = state;\n\nendmodule\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `lfsr` module takes in a clock signal (`clk`), an active-low reset signal (`reset`), and outputs an 8-bit data signal (`data`).\n- Inside the module, a register `state` is declared to store the current state of the LFSR.\n- The `always` block is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock (`posedge clk`) and the falling edge of the reset signal (`negedge reset`).\n- When the reset signal is low, the state is set to the initial value of `8'b10001010`.\n- Otherwise, the state is updated by shifting the bits to the left and XORing the feedback taps at positions 1, 4, 6, and 7.\n- The `assign` statement assigns the current state to the output data signal.\n\nNote: The code assumes that the clock and reset signals are properly connected to the module.\n\nNow, let's move on to the testbench module.\n\nlfsr_tb.v\n```verilog\nmodule lfsr_tb;\n\n  reg clk;\n  reg reset;\n  wire [7:0] data;\n\n  lfsr dut (\n    .clk(clk),\n    .reset(reset),\n    .data(data)\n  );\n\n  initial begin\n    clk = 0;\n    reset = 1;\n    #10 reset = 0;\n  end\n\n  always #5 clk = ~clk;\n\nendmodule\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `lfsr_tb` module is the testbench for the `lfsr` module.\n- It declares a clock signal (`clk`), an active-low reset signal (`reset`), and a wire for the output data signal (`data`).\n- The `lfsr` module (`dut`) is instantiated with the appropriate connections.\n- In the `initial` block, the initial values of `clk` and `reset` are set.\n- After a delay of 10 time units, the reset signal is deasserted by setting it to 0.\n- The `always` block toggles the clock signal every 5 time units.\n\nNote: The testbench code assumes that the `lfsr` module is properly instantiated and connected.\n\nThis completes the implementation of the LFSR Verilog model.
