The necessary blocks for testing the LFSR module are as follows:

1. LFSR module: This is the module that needs to be tested. It generates pseudo-random numbers based on the given specifications.

2. Testbench module: This module is responsible for providing inputs to the LFSR module, monitoring its outputs, and verifying its functionality.

Important edge cases to be tested in the testbench:

1. Initial state: Verify that the LFSR module starts with the correct initial state.

2. Clock edge: Test the functionality of the LFSR module on every rising edge of the clock.

3. Active-low reset: Test the behavior of the LFSR module when the reset signal is activated.

4. Output data: Verify that the output data generated by the LFSR module matches the expected pseudo-random sequence.

5. Continuous operation: Test the LFSR module for continuous generation of pseudo-random numbers.

Now, let's proceed with the testbench module implementation:
