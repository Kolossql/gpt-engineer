Shift enable low: Verifies that the shift register holds the current data without shifting when the shift enable signal is low.\n3. Shift enable high: Verifies that the shift register shifts the data bit on the rising edge of the clock when the shift enable signal is high.\n4. Active-low reset: Verifies that the shift register resets to the initial state when the active-low reset signal is asserted.\n5. Data change: Verifies that the shift register outputs the stored data when it is changed.\n\nThe testbench module can be executed using a Verilog simulator, and the correctness of the outputs can be verified using display statements or by analyzing the waveform using a waveform viewer like GTKWave.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
