The necessary blocks for testing the ABRO module are:
1. ABRO module: The module to be tested.
2. Testbench module: A module that instantiates the ABRO module and provides stimulus inputs and verifies the outputs.
3. Clock generator: A module that generates a clock signal for the testbench.
4. Reset generator: A module that generates an active-low reset signal for the testbench.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Test the initial state where both A and B are not entered.
2. Test the case where A is entered before B.
3. Test the case where B is entered before A.
4. Test the case where both A and B are entered simultaneously.
5. Test the case where the active-low reset signal is triggered.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module.
