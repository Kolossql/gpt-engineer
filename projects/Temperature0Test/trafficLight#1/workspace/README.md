The blocks necessary to properly test the traffic light module are:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the traffic light module and provide the necessary inputs (clock, reset, enable) to test its behavior. It will also monitor the outputs (red, yellow, green) and verify their correctness.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Verify that the module starts in the correct initial state (red light with 32 clock cycles remaining before green).
2. Transition from red to green: Verify that the module transitions from red to green after 32 clock cycles.
3. Transition from green to yellow: Verify that the module transitions from green to yellow after 20 clock cycles.
4. Transition from yellow to red: Verify that the module transitions from yellow to red after 7 clock cycles.
5. Enable signal transitions: Verify that the module correctly pauses and resumes its operation when the enable signal transitions from low to high and high to low.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:
