Inside the module, we define a state machine using an `enum` type to represent the different states of the traffic light. We also declare internal signals `counter`, `current_state`, and `next_state` to keep track of the state transitions and timing. The `always` block with `posedge clk` triggers the state transitions and updates the current state based on the `reset` and `enable` signals. The `always` block with `current_state` triggers the output logic based on the current state and updates the next state based on the counter value. The output signals `red`, `yellow`, `green` are set based on the current state and counter value.\n\nThis completes the implementation of the traffic light module.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
