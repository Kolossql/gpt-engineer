It takes inputs `initial_state`, `clock`, `reset`, `die_select`, and `roll`, and outputs `rolled_number`. Inside the module, we have defined two registers `current_die_select` and `current_rolled_number` to store the current values of `die_select` and `rolled_number` respectively.\n\nIn the `always` block, we have used a clocked process to handle the logic. On the positive edge of the clock or reset, we check if the reset signal is active. If it is, we set the `current_die_select` to 2'b00 and `current_rolled_number` to 8'b0. Otherwise, we update the `current_die_select` with the value of `die_select`. If the `roll` signal is high, we use a case statement to determine the number of sides of the selected die and generate a random number accordingly using the `$random` system function.\n\nIn the second `always` block, we use another clocked process to assign the value of `current_rolled_number` to `rolled_number` on the positive edge of the clock, but only if the `roll` signal is high.\n\nThis completes the implementation of the `DiceRoller` module.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
