The necessary blocks for testing the LFSR module are as follows:

1. LFSR Module: This is the module that needs to be tested. It generates pseudo-random numbers based on the given specifications.

2. Testbench Module: This module is responsible for providing inputs to the LFSR module, simulating the clock signal, and verifying the output.

Important edge cases to be tested in the testbench:

1. Initial State: Verify that the LFSR module generates the correct output when starting from the initial state.

2. Clock Signal: Test the behavior of the LFSR module with different clock frequencies, such as a slow clock and a fast clock.

3. Reset Signal: Test the behavior of the LFSR module when the reset signal is activated and deactivated.

4. Taps: Verify that the LFSR module generates the correct output when the tap positions are changed.

5. Output Sequence: Check the generated pseudo-random number sequence for a specific number of clock cycles to ensure randomness.

Now, let's proceed with the testbench module implementation:
