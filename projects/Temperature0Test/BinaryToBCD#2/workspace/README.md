The blocks necessary to properly test the binary to BCD converter module are:
1. Binary to BCD Converter Module: This is the module that needs to be tested. It takes a 5-bit binary input and converts it to an 8-bit BCD output.
2. Testbench Module: This module is responsible for generating the test inputs, applying them to the binary to BCD converter module, and verifying the correctness of the output.

Important edge cases to be tested in the testbench:
1. Minimum input value (0 in binary)
2. Maximum input value (31 in binary)
3. Input value with all bits set to 1 (31 in binary)
4. Input value with all bits set to 0 (0 in binary)
5. Random input value

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:

**testbench.v**
