The blocks necessary to properly test the module are:
1. Testbench module: This module instantiates the sequence detector module and provides stimulus to its inputs. It also monitors the outputs of the sequence detector module and verifies their correctness.
2. Clock generator: This block generates the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This block generates the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Data generator: This block generates the input data for the testbench module.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Testing the detection of the sequence when the input data matches the specified sequence.
2. Testing the detection of the sequence when the input data does not match the specified sequence.
3. Testing the behavior of the module when the active-low reset signal is asserted.
4. Testing the behavior of the module when invalid input values are provided.

Now I will provide the content of the testbench module including all code:

testbench.v
