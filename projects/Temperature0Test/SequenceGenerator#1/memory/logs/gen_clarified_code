It takes inputs `clk`, `reset`, and `enable`, and outputs `data`. The internal state variable `index` keeps track of the current index in the sequence. The sequence of hexadecimal values is stored in the `sequence` array. The module uses an `always` block to handle the behavior based on the clock and reset signals. When the reset signal is activated (low), the module resets to the initial state (0xAF) and sets the `index` to 0. When the enable signal is high, the module increments the `index` on the rising edge of the clock and outputs the corresponding value from the `sequence` array.\n\nThis completes the implementation of the SequenceGenerator module.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
