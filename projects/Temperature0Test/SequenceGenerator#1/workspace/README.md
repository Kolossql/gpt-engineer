The blocks necessary to properly test the sequence generator module are:
1. Testbench module: This module instantiates the sequence generator module and provides the necessary inputs (clock, active-low reset, enable) to test its functionality. It also captures and verifies the output sequence.
2. Clock generator: This block generates the clock signal with a specified frequency and duty cycle to drive the sequence generator module.
3. Stimulus generator: This block generates the necessary input stimuli (active-low reset, enable) to test different scenarios of the sequence generator module.
4. Output checker: This block checks the output sequence generated by the sequence generator module and verifies if it matches the expected sequence.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Testing the initial state: Verify that the sequence generator module outputs the first element of the sequence (0xAF) when it is initially powered on or reset.
2. Testing clock edge triggering: Verify that the sequence generator module outputs the next part of the sequence when the clock signal has a rising edge.
3. Testing active-low reset: Verify that the sequence generator module resets to the initial state (0xAF) when the active-low reset signal is activated.
4. Testing enable signal: Verify that the sequence generator module generates and outputs the sequence only when the enable signal is high. When the enable signal is low, the module should stop outputting the sequence.
5. Testing sequence repetition: Verify that the sequence generator module repeats the sequence indefinitely when the enable signal is continuously high.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:
