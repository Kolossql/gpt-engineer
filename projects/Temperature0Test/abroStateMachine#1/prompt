I am trying to create a Behavioral Verilog module for an ABRO state machine. It must meet the following specifications:
Initial State: Needs both A and B to be entered before the output is sent
Inputs:
Clock: 
Active-low reset: Resets both A and B so that both must be inputted before the output is sent.
A: must be entered before the output is sent
B: must be entered before the output is sent
Outputs: 
O: 1 if the output state is reached 0 otherwise
State: binary number corresponding to the current state of the module

Other than the main output from ABRO machine, it should output the current state of the machine for use in verification.
