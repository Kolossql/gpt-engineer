The blocks necessary to properly test the ABRO module are:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the ABRO module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs and verify their correctness.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This block will generate the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Stimulus generator: This block will generate the input signals A and B for the testbench module.
5. Output monitor: This block will monitor the output signals O and CurrentState of the ABRO module and display their values during simulation.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Test the initial state where both A and B are not entered.
2. Test the case where A is entered before B.
3. Test the case where B is entered before A.
4. Test the case where both A and B are entered simultaneously.
5. Test the case where the active-low reset signal is triggered.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:

**testbench.v**
