The blocks necessary to properly test the binary to BCD converter module are:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the binary to BCD converter module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also verify the correctness of the BCD output by comparing it with the expected output.
2. Binary to BCD converter module: This is the module that needs to be tested. It takes a 5-bit binary input and converts it into an 8-bit BCD output.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Input value of 0 (00000 in binary)
2. Input value of 31 (11111 in binary)
3. Input value with a binary representation that has leading zeros (e.g., 00011)
4. Input value with a binary representation that has leading ones (e.g., 11100)
5. Random input value within the valid range (e.g., 01010)

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:

**testbench.v**
