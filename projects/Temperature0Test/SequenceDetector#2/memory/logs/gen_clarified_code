It has inputs `clk`, `rst_n`, and `data`, and an output `sequence_found`. The module uses a state machine to detect the sequence of binary input values. The state machine transitions based on the current state and the input data. The `sequence_found` output is set to 1 when the sequence is detected.\n\nThe module defines an enumerated type `State` to represent the different states of the state machine. It also declares internal signals `current_state` and `next_state` to hold the current and next states of the state machine.\n\nThe module has two always blocks. The first always block handles the state transition and output logic. It updates the `current_state` and `sequence_found` registers on the rising edge of the clock or when the reset signal is asserted. The second always block handles the state transition logic based on the current state and input data. It updates the `next_state` signal accordingly.\n\nThe module starts in the `WAITING` state and transitions through the states `DETECTING_1` to `DETECTING_7` based on the input data. If the input data matches the final sequence `3'b101` in the `DETECTING_7` state, the module transitions to the `SEQUENCE_FOUND` state and sets `sequence_found` to 1. If the input data does not match any expected sequence, the module transitions back to the `WAITING` state.\n\nThis completes the implementation of the Verilog model for the sequence detector.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
