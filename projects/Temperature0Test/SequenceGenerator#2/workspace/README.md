The blocks necessary to properly test the sequence generator module are:
1. Testbench module: This module instantiates the sequence generator module and provides the necessary inputs (clock, reset, enable) and captures the outputs (data). It also includes the test cases and verifies the correctness of the output sequence.
2. Clock generator: This module generates the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This module generates the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Enable generator: This module generates the enable signal for the testbench module.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Testing the initial state: Verify that the sequence generator outputs the first element of the sequence (0xAF) when the module is reset.
2. Testing clock edge triggering: Verify that the sequence generator outputs the next element of the sequence when the clock has a rising edge.
3. Testing active-low reset: Verify that the sequence generator resets to the initial state when the active-low reset signal is asserted.
4. Testing enable signal: Verify that the sequence generator stops generating and outputting the sequence when the enable signal is low.
5. Testing continuous generation: Verify that the sequence generator continuously generates and outputs the sequence without stopping.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:

**sequence_generator_tb.v**
