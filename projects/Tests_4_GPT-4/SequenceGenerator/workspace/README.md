The necessary blocks for the testbench are:

1. Initialization block: This block will initialize the inputs and outputs of the module to be tested. It will also set the initial state of the system.

2. Test cases block: This block will contain the test cases that will be used to verify the functionality of the module. Each test case will change the inputs to the module and check the outputs.

3. Verification block: This block will compare the outputs of the module to the expected outputs and display whether the test case passed or failed.

The important edge cases that should be tested are:

1. The sequence generator is enabled and the clock has a rising edge.
2. The sequence generator is enabled and the clock does not have a rising edge.
3. The sequence generator is not enabled and the clock has a rising edge.
4. The sequence generator is not enabled and the clock does not have a rising edge.
5. The active-low reset is triggered while the sequence is being outputted.

The content of the testbench module is as follows:

testbench.v
