The necessary blocks for the testbench are:

- Initialization block: This block is used to initialize the inputs and outputs of the ABROStateMachine module.
- Stimulus block: This block is used to provide different input combinations to the ABROStateMachine module.
- Monitor block: This block is used to monitor the outputs of the ABROStateMachine module and check if they match the expected results.

The important edge cases that should be tested are:

- Both inputs A and B are low.
- Only input A is high.
- Only input B is high.
- Both inputs A and B are high.
- The reset_n input is low.

The testbench module is as follows:

testbench.v
