The necessary blocks for the testbench are:

1. Initialization: This block will initialize the inputs and outputs of the module.
2. Test Case 1: This block will test the initial state of the module.
3. Test Case 2: This block will test the transition from red to green after 32 clock cycles.
4. Test Case 3: This block will test the transition from green to yellow after 20 clock cycles.
5. Test Case 4: This block will test the transition from yellow to red after 7 clock cycles.
6. Test Case 5: This block will test the behavior of the module when the 'Enable' input is switched from low to high.

Important edge cases to test:

1. The behavior of the module when the 'Active-low reset' is triggered while the module is operating.
2. The behavior of the module when multiple inputs (Clock, Active-low reset, Enable) change at the same time.
