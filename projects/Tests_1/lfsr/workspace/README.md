The necessary blocks for testing the LFSR module are as follows:

1. LFSR Testbench: This is the top-level module that instantiates the LFSR module and provides the necessary inputs and outputs for testing.
2. Clock Generator: This block generates the clock signal for the testbench.
3. Reset Generator: This block generates the active-low reset signal for the testbench.
4. Monitor: This block monitors the outputs of the LFSR module and captures the generated pseudo-random numbers for verification.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Verify that the LFSR module starts with the correct initial state (10001010).
2. Clock edge: Test the behavior of the LFSR module on both rising and falling edges of the clock signal.
3. Reset signal: Test the behavior of the LFSR module when the reset signal is activated and deactivated.
4. Continuous operation: Verify that the LFSR module continuously generates pseudo-random numbers on every clock cycle.
5. Output verification: Compare the generated pseudo-random numbers with the expected sequence to ensure correctness.

Now, let's proceed with the code implementation.
