It instantiates the LFSR module, generates the clock signal, generates the reset signal, and monitors the output data. It also includes test cases to verify the behavior of the LFSR module.\n\nThe testbench tests the following cases:\n1. Initial state: Verifies that the LFSR module starts with the correct initial state (10001010).\n2. Clock edge: Tests the behavior of the LFSR module on both rising and falling edges of the clock signal.\n3. Reset signal: Tests the behavior of the LFSR module when the reset signal is activated and deactivated.\n4. Continuous operation: Verifies that the LFSR module continuously generates pseudo-random numbers on every clock cycle.\n5.

Install the necessary Verilog simulator (e.g., Icarus Verilog):\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install iverilog\n```\n\n2. Compile the Verilog code:\n```bash\niverilog -o lfsr_testbench lfsr_testbench.v\n```\n\n3. Run the simulation:\n```bash\nvvp lfsr_testbench\n```\n\nThis will execute the testbench and display the output of the test cases.\n\nPlease note that the above commands assume you have the necessary Verilog simulator installed on your system.
