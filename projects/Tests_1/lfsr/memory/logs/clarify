The active-low reset signal is assumed to be triggered by bringing the signal low and then back to high.\n3. When the reset signal is active, the LFSR module is assumed to reset to the initial state (10001010) immediately.\n4. The LFSR module is assumed to continuously generate pseudo-random numbers on every rising edge of the clock signal.\n5. The LFSR module is assumed to only have the clock and active-low reset inputs, and the 8-bit data output.\n6. When the clock signal is not active (low), the LFSR module is assumed to hold its current state and not generate any output.\n7. The LFSR module is assumed to have an internal shift register to store the current state and perform the shift operation.\n8. The LFSR module is assumed to ignore any invalid or unexpected input values and continue normal operation.\n\nPlease let me know if any of these assumptions are incorrect or if you would like me to seek clarification on any specific aspect."
