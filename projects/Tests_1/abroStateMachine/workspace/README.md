The necessary blocks for testing the ABRO state machine module are:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the ABRO state machine module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs and verify the expected behavior.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This block will generate the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Stimulus generator: This block will generate the stimulus for the A and B inputs of the ABRO state machine module.
5. Monitor: This block will monitor the outputs of the ABRO state machine module and compare them with the expected behavior.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. A and B inputs are entered in the correct order and the output state is reached.
2. A and B inputs are entered in the incorrect order and the output state is not reached.
3. A and B inputs are entered in the correct order, but the active-low reset signal is asserted before the output state is reached.
4. A and B inputs are entered in the correct order, but the active-low reset signal is asserted after the output state is reached.
5. A and B inputs are entered in the correct order, but the clock signal is not provided.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:
