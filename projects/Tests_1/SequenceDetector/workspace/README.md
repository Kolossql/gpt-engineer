The necessary blocks for testing the module are as follows:

1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the sequence detector module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs of the sequence detector module and verify their correctness.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:

1. Testing the sequence detection when the sequence is found.
2. Testing the sequence detection when the sequence is not found.
3. Testing the sequence detection when the sequence is partially found.
4. Testing the sequence detection when the sequence is found multiple times.
5. Testing the sequence detection with different input sequences.

Here is the content of the testbench module:
