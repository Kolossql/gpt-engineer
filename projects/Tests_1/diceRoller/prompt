I am trying to create a Behavioral Verilog module for a simulated dice roller. It must meet the following specifications:
Inputs:
Initial State: 4-sided die, roll set to 0.
Clock: Outputs the rolled number on a clock rising edge only if roll is high.
Active-low reset: sets the module to its initial state
Die select (2-bits): 00 for 4-sided, 01 for 6-sided, 10 for 8-sided, 11 for 20-sided
Roll: 1 if a die should be simulated on a clock rising edge or 0 if it shouldn't be simulated
Outputs:
Rolled number (8-bits): decimal number that is the result of the simulated dice roll

The design should simulate rolling either a 4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, or 20-sided die, based on
the input die select. It should roll when the roll input goes high and output the random number
based on the number of sides of the selected die.
