Initial state: It checks if the module starts with the correct initial state.\n2. Clock edge: It tests the behavior of the module when the clock is not on a rising edge.\n3. Roll input low: It tests the behavior of the module when the roll input is low.\n4. Invalid die select: It tests the behavior of the module when the die select input is not one of the specified values.\n5. Random number generation: It verifies that the module generates the correct random number for each die select value.\n\nThe testbench module instantiates the module under test (`dice_roller`) and provides stimulus to its inputs (`clk`, `reset`, `die_select`, `roll`). It also monitors the output (`rolled_number`) and checks if it is correct. The clock generator generates the clock signal, the reset generator generates the active-low reset signal, and the stimulus generator generates the stimulus for the inputs. The monitor displays the value of the rolled number on every clock edge."}]
