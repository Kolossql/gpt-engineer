DiceRoller: This is the top-level module that instantiates the other modules and connects them together. It handles the clock, reset, die select, and roll inputs, and generates the rolled number output.\n\n2. RandomGenerator: This module generates a random number using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) algorithm. It takes a seed value and produces a pseudo-random sequence of bits.\n\n3. DieSelector: This module takes the die select input and generates the appropriate number of sides for the dice roll.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the code implementation.\n\n**dice_roller.v**\n\n```verilog\nmodule dice_roller (\n  input wire clk,\n  input wire reset_n,\n  input wire [1:0] die_select,\n  input wire roll,\n  output wire [7:0] rolled_number\n);\n\n  // Instantiate modules\n  RandomGenerator random_gen (\n    .clk(clk),\n    .reset_n(reset_n),\n    .roll(roll),\n    .random_number(rolled_number)\n  );\n\n  DieSelector die_selector (\n    .die_select(die_select),\n    .sides(rolled_number)\n  );\n\nendmodule\n```\n\n**random_generator.v**\n\n```verilog\nmodule RandomGenerator (\n  input wire clk,\n  input wire reset_n,\n  input wire roll,\n  output wire [7:0] random_number\n);\n\n  reg [7:0] seed;\n  reg [7:0] lfsr;\n\n  always @(posedge clk or negedge reset_n) begin\n    if (~reset_n) begin\n      seed <= 8'h00; // Initial seed value\n      lfsr <= seed;\n    end else if (roll) begin\n      lfsr <= {lfsr[6:0], lfsr[7] ^ lfsr[2]}; // LFSR algorithm\n    end\n  end\n\n  assign random_number = lfsr;\n\nendmodule\n```\n\n**die_selector.v**\n\n```verilog\nmodule DieSelector (\n  input wire [1:0] die_select,\n  output wire [7:0] sides\n);\n\n  always @(*) begin\n    case (die_select)\n      2'b00: sides = 4; // 4-sided die\n      2'b01: sides = 6; // 6-sided die\n      2'b10: sides = 8; // 8-sided die\n      2'b11: sides = 20; // 20-sided die\n      default: sides = 4; // Default to 4-sided die\n    endcase\n  end\n\nendmodule\n```\n\nThis completes the implementation of the simulated dice roller in Verilog. The `dice_roller` module is the top-level module that instantiates the `RandomGenerator` and `DieSelector` modules. The `RandomGenerator` module generates a pseudo-random number using an LFSR algorithm, and the `DieSelector` module determines the number of sides for the dice roll based on the die select input."}]
