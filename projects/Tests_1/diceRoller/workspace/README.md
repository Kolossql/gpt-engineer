The necessary blocks for testing the module are:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the module under test and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs and check if they are correct.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This block will generate the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Stimulus generator: This block will generate the stimulus for the inputs of the module under test.
5. Monitor: This block will monitor the outputs of the module under test and check if they are correct.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Verify that the module starts with the correct initial state (4-sided die, roll set to 0).
2. Clock edge: Test the behavior of the module when the clock is not on a rising edge.
3. Roll input low: Test the behavior of the module when the roll input is low.
4. Invalid die select: Test the behavior of the module when the die select input is not one of the specified values (00, 01, 10, 11).
5. Random number generation: Verify that the module generates the correct random number for each die select value.

Now I will provide the content of the testbench module:

testbench.v
