Inside the module, we declare a register named \"data\" to store the data bits. We use an always block sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal. Within the always block, we check for the reset signal and set the data to the initial state if the reset signal is active. If the shift enable signal is active, we perform the shifting operation by concatenating the existing data bits with the new data bit. Finally, we assign the data_out signal to the stored data.\n\nThis completes the implementation of the ShiftRegister module."}]
