The blocks necessary to properly test the sequence generator module are:
1. Testbench module: This module is responsible for generating the clock, reset, enable, and data signals to test the sequence generator module.
2. Clock generator: This block generates the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Stimulus generator: This block generates the stimulus signals (reset, enable) for the testbench module.
4. Monitor: This block monitors the output of the sequence generator module and checks if it matches the expected sequence.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Test the initial state of the sequence generator by asserting the reset signal and checking if the output matches the first element of the sequence.
2. Test the sequence generator when the enable signal is low and ensure that the output remains unchanged.
3. Test the sequence generator when the enable signal is high and ensure that the output follows the sequence.
4. Test the sequence generator when the active-low reset signal is asserted and ensure that the output returns to the initial state.
5. Test the sequence generator for multiple cycles to ensure that it repeats the sequence correctly.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:
