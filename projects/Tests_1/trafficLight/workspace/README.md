The blocks necessary to properly test the traffic light module are:
1. Clock generator: Generates the clock signal for the testbench.
2. Reset generator: Generates the active-low reset signal for the testbench.
3. Enable generator: Generates the enable signal for the testbench.
4. Traffic light module instance: Instantiates the traffic light module being tested.
5. Monitor: Monitors the outputs of the traffic light module and checks for correctness.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Verify that the traffic light module starts in the correct initial state (red light with 32 clock cycles remaining before green).
2. Transition from red to green: Verify that the traffic light module transitions from red to green after 32 clock cycles.
3. Transition from green to yellow: Verify that the traffic light module transitions from green to yellow after 20 clock cycles.
4. Transition from yellow to red: Verify that the traffic light module transitions from yellow to red after 7 clock cycles.
5. Enable signal low: Verify that the traffic light module pauses operation when the enable signal is low and maintains its current state.

Now let's proceed with the testbench module:
