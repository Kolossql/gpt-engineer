Inside the module, we have declared a state enumeration type to represent the different states of the traffic light. The state register \"current_state\" stores the current state of the traffic light. The counter register \"counter\" counts the clock cycles for each state transition.\n\nThe output logic assigns the values of the output signals based on the current state. The state machine logic is implemented using an always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock or the positive edge of the reset signal. When the reset signal is asserted, the state is set to RED and the counter is reset to 0. When the enable signal is high, the state transitions are determined based on the current state and the counter value. The counter is incremented for each clock cycle, and when it reaches the specified count for a state transition, the current state is updated accordingly, and the counter is reset to 0.\n\nThis completes the implementation of the \"traffic_light\" module."}]
