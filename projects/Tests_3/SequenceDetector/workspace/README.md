The necessary blocks for testing the module are as follows:

1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the sequence detector module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs of the sequence detector module and verify their correctness.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:

1. Testing the sequence detection with the minimum input values.
2. Testing the sequence detection with the maximum input values.
3. Testing the sequence detection with a sequence that is not present in the specified sequences.
4. Testing the sequence detection with overlapping sequences.
5. Testing the sequence detection with multiple sequences in a row.

Here is the content of the testbench module:
