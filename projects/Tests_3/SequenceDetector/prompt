I am trying to create a Verilog model for a sequence detector. It must meet the following specifications:
Initial state: Waiting to detect the first element of the sequence as described below
Inputs:
Clock: Checks the input data on a clock rising edge
Active-low reset: resets the module to the initial state
Data (3 bits): The incoming data that should be checked 
Outputs:
Sequence found: 1 if the last element of the sequence was just inputted, otherwise 0

While enabled, it should detect the following sequence of binary input values:
	- 0b001
	- 0b101
	- 0b110
	- 0b000
	- 0b110
	- 0b110
	- 0b011
	- 0b101
