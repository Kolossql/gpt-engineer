It uses a `reg` variable `current_number` to store the rolled number. The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset signal. Inside the `always` block, the module checks the reset signal and sets the `current_number` to the initial state if the reset is asserted. If the roll input is high, the module uses a `case` statement to determine the number of sides of the selected die and generates a random number accordingly using the `$random` system function. The rolled number is assigned to the `rolled_number` output.\n\nThis completes the implementation of the `DiceRoller` module.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
