The module takes in clock, reset, and enable signals as inputs and outputs the data signal, which represents the current element of the sequence. The module uses a state variable to keep track of the current element and updates it based on the rising edge of the clock signal. The sequence of hexadecimal values is defined as a parameter and is outputted based on the current state.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further clarification or if there's anything else I can assist you with.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
