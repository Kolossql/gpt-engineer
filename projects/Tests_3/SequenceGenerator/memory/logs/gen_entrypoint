Testbench module: This module will instantiate the sequence generator module and provide the necessary inputs for testing.\n2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal for the testbench module.\n3. Reset generator: This block will generate the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.\n4. Enable generator: This block will generate the enable signal for the testbench module.\n5. Monitor: This block will monitor the outputs of the sequence generator module and compare them with the expected values.\n\nImportant edge cases to test in the testbench:\n\n1. Initial state: Verify that the sequence generator outputs the first element of the sequence when it is in the initial state.\n2. Clock edge: Verify that the sequence generator outputs the next element of the sequence when the clock has a rising edge.\n3. Active-low reset: Verify that the sequence generator resets to the initial state when the active-low reset signal is asserted.\n4. Enable signal: Verify that the sequence generator only outputs the sequence when the enable signal is high.\n5.
