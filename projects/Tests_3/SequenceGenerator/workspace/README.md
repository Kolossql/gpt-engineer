The blocks necessary for testing the sequence generator module are as follows:

1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the sequence generator module and provide the necessary inputs for testing.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This block will generate the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Enable generator: This block will generate the enable signal for the testbench module.
5. Monitor: This block will monitor the outputs of the sequence generator module and compare them with the expected values.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:

1. Initial state: Verify that the sequence generator outputs the first element of the sequence when it is in the initial state.
2. Clock edge: Verify that the sequence generator outputs the next element of the sequence when the clock has a rising edge.
3. Active-low reset: Verify that the sequence generator resets to the initial state when the active-low reset signal is asserted.
4. Enable signal: Verify that the sequence generator only outputs the sequence when the enable signal is high.
5. Sequence repetition: Verify that the sequence generator repeats the sequence after outputting all the elements.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:

testbench.v
