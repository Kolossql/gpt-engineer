The blocks necessary to properly test the binary to BCD converter module are as follows:

1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the binary to BCD converter module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs and compare them with expected values to verify the correctness of the converter module.

2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal required for the operation of the modules. It can be a simple Verilog module that generates a clock signal with a specified frequency.

3. Stimulus generator: This block will generate different test cases for the binary input to be fed into the binary to BCD converter module. It can be a separate module or part of the testbench module itself.

4. Monitor: This block will monitor the outputs of the binary to BCD converter module and compare them with expected values. It will generate pass/fail signals based on the comparison results.

Important edge cases to be tested in the testbench:

1. Minimum input value (0): Test the conversion of the minimum binary input value to BCD.

2. Maximum input value (255): Test the conversion of the maximum binary input value to BCD.

3. Random input values: Test the conversion of random binary input values to BCD.

4. Input values with leading zeros: Test the conversion of binary input values with leading zeros to BCD.

5. Input values with all ones: Test the conversion of binary input values with all ones to BCD.

Now, let's proceed with the implementation of the testbench module:
