Inside the module, we declare a register called stored_data to store the 8-bit data. We use an always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal to perform the shifting operation. If the reset signal is low, the stored_data is set to the initial state of 8'b00000000. If the shift_enable signal is high, the data_in is shifted into the stored_data register. Finally, we assign the data_out signal to the stored_data, which represents the output of the module.\n\nThis completes the implementation of the ShiftRegister module.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
