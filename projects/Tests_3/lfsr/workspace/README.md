The necessary blocks for testing the LFSR module are as follows:

1. LFSR Module: This is the module that needs to be tested. It generates a pseudo-random output based on the clock and reset signals.

2. Testbench Module: This module is responsible for providing the clock and reset signals to the LFSR module and verifying the output.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:

1. Initial State: Verify that the LFSR module generates the correct output when starting from the initial state (10001010).

2. Clock Edge: Test the behavior of the LFSR module when the clock signal transitions from low to high.

3. Reset Signal: Test the behavior of the LFSR module when the reset signal is activated.

4. Multiple Clock Edges: Test the behavior of the LFSR module when multiple clock edges occur.

5. Long Sequence: Verify that the LFSR module generates a long sequence of pseudo-random numbers without repeating.

Now, let's proceed with the testbench module:
