The blocks necessary to properly test the traffic light module are:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the traffic light module and provide the necessary inputs and verify the outputs.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Stimulus generator: This block will generate the necessary stimulus for the inputs of the traffic light module.
4. Monitor: This block will monitor the outputs of the traffic light module and check if they are correct.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Test the initial state of the traffic light module.
2. Test the transition from red to green.
3. Test the transition from green to yellow.
4. Test the transition from yellow to red.
5. Test the behavior of the module when the enable signal is low.

Now, let's proceed with the testbench module:

testbench.v
