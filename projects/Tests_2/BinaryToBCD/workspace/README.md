The blocks necessary for testing the binary to BCD converter module are:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the binary to BCD converter module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs and verify their correctness.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate a clock signal to drive the testbench and the DUT (Design Under Test).
3. Stimulus generator: This block will generate different test cases for the binary input to be applied to the DUT.
4. Monitor: This block will monitor the BCD output from the DUT and compare it with the expected output.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Input value 0 (00000)
2. Input value 31 (11111)
3. Input value with all bits set to 1 (11111)
4. Input value with all bits set to 0 (00000)
5. Random input value

Now, let's proceed with the testbench module:
