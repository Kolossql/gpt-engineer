The necessary blocks for testing the module are as follows:

1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the module under test and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs and verify their correctness.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:

1. Testing the initial state of the 4-sided die.
2. Testing the roll input when it is low.
3. Testing the behavior of the module when the active-low reset signal is asserted.
4. Testing invalid values for the die select input.
5. Testing the generation of random numbers for the simulated dice roll.

Now I will provide the content of the testbench module.
