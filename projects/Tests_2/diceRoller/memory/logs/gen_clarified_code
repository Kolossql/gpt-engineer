It includes inputs for the initial state, clock, reset, die select, and roll, as well as an output for the rolled number. Inside the `always` block, the module checks for a rising edge of the clock or a falling edge of the reset signal. If the reset signal is low, the module resets the rolled number and current die select to their initial values. Otherwise, if the roll input is high and the die select has changed, the module generates a random number based on the selected die and updates the rolled number and current die select accordingly. The rolled number is assigned to the `rolled_number` output.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
