ShiftRegister: This is the main module that implements the shift register functionality. It contains the logic for shifting the data bit on the rising edge of the clock when the shift enable signal is high, and for resetting the module to the initial state when the active-low reset signal is active.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the code implementation.\n\n**shift_register.v**\n```verilog\nmodule ShiftRegister (\n  input wire clk,\n  input wire reset,\n  input wire shift_enable,\n  input wire data_in,\n  output wire [7:0] data_out\n);\n\n  reg [7:0] stored_data;\n\n  always @(posedge clk) begin\n    if (reset == 0) begin\n      stored_data <= 8'b00000000;\n    end else if (shift_enable == 1) begin\n      stored_data <= {stored_data[6:0], data_in};\n    end\n  end\n\n  assign data_out = stored_data;\n\nendmodule\n```\n\nIn the above code, we define a module called `ShiftRegister` with the specified inputs and outputs. Inside the module, we declare a register `stored_data` to store the 8-bit data.\n\nThe `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal (`@(posedge clk)`). Inside the `always` block, we check the value of the reset signal. If it is low (active-low reset), we set the `stored_data` to the initial state of 8'b00000000. If the reset signal is high, we check the value of the shift enable signal. If it is high, we shift the `data_in` bit into the `stored_data` by concatenating it with the right-shifted `stored_data`.\n\nFinally, we assign the `stored_data` to the `data_out` output.\n\nThis completes the implementation of the shift register module.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
