The necessary blocks for testing the Verilog module are as follows:

1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the sequence detector module and provide the necessary inputs for testing. It will also monitor the outputs and verify their correctness.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:

1. Testing the detection of a valid sequence: Provide the input sequence that matches one of the specified sequences and verify that the "Sequence found" output is asserted.

2. Testing the detection of an invalid sequence: Provide an input sequence that does not match any of the specified sequences and verify that the "Sequence found" output remains deasserted.

3. Testing the detection of a sequence with incorrect order: Provide an input sequence that matches one of the specified sequences but with the elements in a different order. Verify that the "Sequence found" output remains deasserted.

4. Testing the detection of a sequence with additional elements: Provide an input sequence that matches one of the specified sequences but with additional elements before or after the sequence. Verify that the "Sequence found" output remains deasserted.

5. Testing the active-low reset functionality: Assert and deassert the reset signal at different points during the testing to ensure that the module resets to the initial state correctly.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:

**testbench.v**
