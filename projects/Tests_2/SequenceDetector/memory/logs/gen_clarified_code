It has inputs `clk`, `reset`, and `data`, and an output `sequence_found`. The module uses a sequential logic block to detect the specified sequence based on the current state. The state transitions are defined using a case statement. When the sequence is detected, the `sequence_found_reg` is set to 1, indicating that the sequence was found. The output `sequence_found` is assigned the value of `sequence_found_reg`.\n\nThe module also includes a localparam block to define the constants for the different states of the sequence detection process.\n\nThis completes the Verilog model for the sequence detector.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
