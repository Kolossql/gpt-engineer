Continuous generation: Verifies that the LFSR module continuously generates pseudo-random numbers on every rising edge of the clock.\n\n5. Output verification: Verifies the correctness of the generated pseudo-random numbers by comparing them with the expected values.\n\nThe testbench module instantiates the LFSR module and provides inputs (clock and reset) to it. It also monitors the output (data_out) of the LFSR module and verifies the correctness of the generated pseudo-random numbers using display statements.\n\nTo run the testbench and verify the output, you can use a Verilog simulator such as ModelSim or Icarus Verilog. Additionally, you can use a waveform viewer like GTKWave to visualize the waveforms and observe the behavior of the LFSR module.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
