The `lfsr` module takes in a clock signal (`clk`), an active-low reset signal (`reset`), and outputs an 8-bit pseudo-random number (`data`). The LFSR module is implemented using a synchronous always block, which updates the state of the LFSR based on the clock and reset signals. The taps for the LFSR are located at positions 1, 4, 6, and 7, and the state is shifted accordingly. The output data is assigned to the current state of the LFSR.\n\nThe `lfsr_tb` module is a simple testbench module that instantiates the `lfsr` module and provides the necessary inputs (`clk` and `reset`) and captures the output (`data`). The clock signal is toggled every 5 time units, and the reset signal is activated for 10 time units before being de-asserted. The simulation is terminated after 100 time units using the `$finish` system task.\n\nPlease note that the testbench module is not required for the Verilog code to function as a standalone LFSR module. It is provided here for testing and verification purposes.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
