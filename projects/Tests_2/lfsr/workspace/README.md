The necessary blocks for testing the LFSR module are as follows:

1. LFSR Module: This is the module that needs to be tested. It generates pseudo-random numbers based on the given specifications.

2. Testbench Module: This module is responsible for providing inputs to the LFSR module, monitoring its outputs, and verifying the correctness of the generated pseudo-random numbers.

Important edge cases to be tested in the testbench:

1. Initial state: Verify that the LFSR module starts with the correct initial state (10001010).

2. Clock edge: Test the behavior of the LFSR module on every rising edge of the clock.

3. Active-low reset: Test the behavior of the LFSR module when the reset signal is activated.

4. Continuous generation: Verify that the LFSR module continuously generates pseudo-random numbers on every rising edge of the clock.

5. Output verification: Verify the correctness of the generated pseudo-random numbers by comparing them with the expected values.

Now, let's proceed with the implementation of the testbench module.
