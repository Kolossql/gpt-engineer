SequenceGenerator: This block generates the output sequence based on the clock, active-low reset, and enable signals.\n\nNow let's proceed with the file contents.\n\n**sequence_generator.v**\n```verilog\nmodule SequenceGenerator (\n  input wire clk,\n  input wire rst_n,\n  input wire enable,\n  output reg [7:0] data\n);\n\n  reg [7:0] sequence [7:0] = {8'hAF, 8'hBC, 8'hE2, 8'h78, 8'hFF, 8'hE2, 8'h0B, 8'h8D};\n  reg [2:0] state;\n\n  always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin\n    if (~rst_n) begin\n      state <= 0;\n      data <= sequence[0];\n    end else if (enable) begin\n      state <= state + 1;\n      data <= sequence[state];\n    end\n  end\n\nendmodule\n```\n\nThis Verilog module `SequenceGenerator` takes in the clock (`clk`), active-low reset (`rst_n`), and enable (`enable`) signals as inputs. It outputs the data sequence as an 8-bit value (`data`).\n\nThe `sequence` array holds the sequence of hexadecimal values. The `state` variable keeps track of the current state of the sequence generator.\n\nInside the `always` block, we have a clocked process that triggers on the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset signal. When the reset signal is asserted (`~rst_n`), the state is set to 0 and the data output is set to the first element of the sequence (`sequence[0]`).\n\nWhen the enable signal is high, the state is incremented by 1 (`state <= state + 1`) and the data output is updated with the corresponding element from the sequence (`data <= sequence[state]`).\n\nNow let's move on to the entrypoint file.\n\n**main.v**\n```verilog\nmodule Main;\n\n  reg clk;\n  reg rst_n;\n  reg enable;\n  wire [7:0] data;\n\n  SequenceGenerator sequence_gen (\n    .clk(clk),\n    .rst_n(rst_n),\n    .enable(enable),\n    .data(data)\n  );\n\n  initial begin\n    clk = 0;\n    forever #5 clk = ~clk;\n  end\n\n  initial begin\n    rst_n = 0;\n    #10 rst_n = 1;\n  end\n\n  initial begin\n    enable = 1;\n    #100 enable = 0;\n    #100 enable = 1;\n    #100 enable = 0;\n    #100 enable = 1;\n    #100 enable = 0;\n    #100 enable = 1;\n    #100 enable = 0;\n    #100 enable = 1;\n  end\n\nendmodule\n```\n\nThis Verilog module `Main` serves as the entrypoint for the design. It instantiates the `SequenceGenerator` module and connects the input and output signals.\n\nThe `clk` signal is a regular register that toggles every 5 time units using an `initial` block with a `forever` loop.\n\nThe `rst_n` signal is a regular register that is initially set to 0 and then asserted to 1 after 10 time units.\n\nThe `enable` signal is a regular register that is initially set to 1. It is then toggled between 0 and 1 every 100 time units using a series of `#delay` statements.\n\nThe `data` signal is a wire that receives the output sequence from the `SequenceGenerator` module.\n\nThis completes the implementation of the sequence generator module and the entrypoint module.
