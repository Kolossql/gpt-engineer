The blocks necessary to properly test the traffic light module are:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the traffic light module and provide the necessary inputs for testing.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This block will generate the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Enable generator: This block will generate the enable signal for the testbench module.
5. Monitor: This block will monitor the outputs of the traffic light module and display them for verification.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Verify that the traffic light module starts in the correct initial state (red light with 32 clock cycles remaining before green).
2. Timing transitions: Verify that the traffic light module transitions from red to green after 32 clock cycles, from green to yellow after 20 clock cycles, and from yellow to red after 7 clock cycles.
3. Active-low reset: Verify that the traffic light module resets to the initial state when the active-low reset signal is asserted.
4. Enable signal changes: Verify that the traffic light module responds correctly to changes in the enable signal, both from low to high and from high to low.
5. Clock signal absence: Verify that the traffic light module does not perform any state transitions or update its outputs when the clock signal is not provided.

Now I will provide the content of the testbench module including all code.
