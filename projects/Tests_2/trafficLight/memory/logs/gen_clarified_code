It takes inputs `clk`, `reset_n`, and `enable`, and provides outputs `red`, `yellow`, and `green`. The module uses internal registers to keep track of the current state and the counters for each timing sequence. The state machine logic is implemented using an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset signal. The state transitions and counter increments are controlled based on the current state and the enable signal.\n\nThe module defines three states: `STATE_RED`, `STATE_GREEN`, and `STATE_YELLOW`, represented by 2-bit values. The output assignments for `red`, `yellow`, and `green` are based on the current state.\n\nThe state machine transitions are as follows:\n- From `STATE_RED` to `STATE_GREEN` after 32 clock cycles (red_counter reaches 31).\n- From `STATE_GREEN` to `STATE_YELLOW` after 20 clock cycles (green_counter reaches 19).\n- From `STATE_YELLOW` to `STATE_RED` after 7 clock cycles (yellow_counter reaches 6).\n\nThe counters `red_counter`, `green_counter`, and `yellow_counter` are reset to zero when the module is reset or when the state transitions occur.\n\nThis Verilog module can be used as the top-level module in a Verilog design.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
