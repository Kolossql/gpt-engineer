It includes a state register `current_state` to keep track of the current state, and a counter `counter` to count the clock cycles. The module transitions between states based on the counter value and the enable signal. The outputs `red`, `yellow`, and `green` are assigned based on the current state.\n\nThe state machine logic is implemented using an `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal or the positive edge of the reset signal. When the reset signal is asserted, the state is set to `STATE_RED` and the counter is reset to 0. When the enable signal is asserted, the state transitions are determined based on the current state and the counter value. The counter is incremented on each clock cycle.\n\nThe outputs `red`, `yellow`, and `green` are assigned based on the current state using the `assign` statements.\n\nThis module follows the 2005 Verilog standard and does not use any SystemVerilog features.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}, {"type": "human", "data": {"content": "Below is the caravel user project wrapper.
