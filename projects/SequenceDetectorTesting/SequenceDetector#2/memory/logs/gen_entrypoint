Initial state: The sequence detector module is in the initial state and the sequence has not been detected yet.\n2.

Sequence at the end: The sequence occurs at the end of the input data.\n5. Non-detection of sequence: The input data does not match any part of the sequence.\n\nThe testbench module uses display statements to print the value of the `sequence_found` output at different points in time. This allows us to verify the correctness of the sequence detection.
