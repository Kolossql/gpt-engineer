The necessary blocks for testing the sequence detector module are as follows:

1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the sequence detector module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs of the sequence detector module and verify their correctness.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:

1. Testing the initial state of the sequence detector module.
2. Testing the detection of the sequence when it occurs at the beginning of the input data.
3. Testing the detection of the sequence when it occurs in the middle of the input data.
4. Testing the detection of the sequence when it occurs at the end of the input data.
5. Testing the non-detection of the sequence when the input data does not match any part of the sequence.

Now, let's write the content of the testbench module:

testbench.v
