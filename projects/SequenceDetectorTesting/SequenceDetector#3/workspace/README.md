The blocks necessary to properly test the sequence detector module are:
1. Testbench module: This module instantiates the sequence detector module and provides stimulus to its inputs. It also monitors the outputs of the sequence detector module and verifies their correctness.
2. Clock generator: This block generates the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This block generates the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Stimulus generator: This block generates the input data sequence to be tested by the sequence detector module.
5. Monitor: This block monitors the outputs of the sequence detector module and captures them for verification.

Important edge cases to be tested in the testbench:
1. Testing the detection of the specified sequence when it occurs at the beginning of the input data.
2. Testing the detection of the specified sequence when it occurs in the middle of the input data.
3. Testing the detection of the specified sequence when it occurs at the end of the input data.
4. Testing the detection of the specified sequence when it occurs multiple times in the input data.
5. Testing the case where the input data does not match any of the specified sequences.

Now let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:

**testbench.v**
