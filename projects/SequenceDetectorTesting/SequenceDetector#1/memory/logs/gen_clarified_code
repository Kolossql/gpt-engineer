It takes inputs `clk`, `reset_n`, and `data` and provides an output `sequence_found`. The module uses a state machine to detect the specified sequence. The state machine transitions based on the input data and the current state. The output `sequence_found` is set to 1 when the sequence is detected in the final state `S7`.\n\nThe state machine transitions are defined using a case statement. Each state checks the input data and transitions to the next state if the data matches the expected value. If the data does not match, the state transitions back to the initial state `IDLE`. The state machine is synchronous to the positive edge of the clock signal.\n\nThe `sequence_found` output is assigned the value 1 when the state is `S7`, indicating that the sequence has been detected.\n\nThis completes the implementation of the `SequenceDetector` module.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
