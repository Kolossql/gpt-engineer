The blocks necessary to properly test the module are:
1. Testbench module: This module instantiates the sequence detector module and provides stimulus to its inputs. It also monitors the outputs of the sequence detector module and checks if they match the expected values.
2. Clock generator: This block generates the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This block generates the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Input data generator: This block generates the input data for the testbench module.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Testing the detection of the sequence when it occurs at the beginning of the input data.
2. Testing the detection of the sequence when it occurs at the end of the input data.
3. Testing the detection of the sequence when it occurs in the middle of the input data.
4. Testing the detection of the sequence when it occurs multiple times consecutively.
5. Testing the detection of the sequence when it occurs with other non-sequence data in between.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:
