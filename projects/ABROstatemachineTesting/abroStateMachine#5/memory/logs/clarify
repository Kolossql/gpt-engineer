The Clock input is assumed to be a regular clock signal with no specific requirements mentioned in the specifications.\n2. The Active-low reset input is assumed to be an asynchronous reset, meaning it can be triggered at any time regardless of the clock signal.\n3. If A and B are not both high in any order before the output is sent, the module will not change its state and the output will remain unchanged.\n4. If A or B is high more than once before the output is sent, it will not affect the module's behavior. The module only requires A and B to be high at least once before the output is sent.\n5. When the output is sent, the module is assumed to reset to its initial state, meaning all internal variables and registers are reset to their default values.\n6. The state is assumed to be represented as a binary number with a fixed number of bits. The range of possible states is not specified, so it will be assumed to be within the range representable by the given number of bits.\n7. The current state of the machine is assumed to be outputted whenever there is a change in the state. There is no specific timing requirement mentioned, so it will be assumed that the current state can be outputted immediately after a state change occurs.\n8.
