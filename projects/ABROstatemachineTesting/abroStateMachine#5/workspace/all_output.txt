The necessary blocks for testing the ABRO state machine module are as follows:

1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the ABRO state machine module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs and verify the expected behavior.

2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal required for the ABRO state machine module. It can be a simple module that toggles the clock signal at a specified frequency.

3. Stimulus generator: This block will generate the stimulus for the inputs of the ABRO state machine module. It will provide the necessary inputs such as A, B, and the active-low reset signal in different test cases.

4. Monitor: This block will monitor the outputs of the ABRO state machine module and check if they match the expected behavior.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:

1. Initial state: Test the behavior of the module when it is in the initial state and no inputs have been provided yet.

2. Single input: Test the behavior of the module when only one of the inputs (A or B) is high before the output is sent.

3. Both inputs in different order: Test the behavior of the module when both inputs (A and B) are high, but in a different order than the initial state.

4. Multiple inputs: Test the behavior of the module when both inputs (A and B) are high multiple times before the output is sent.

5. Output and reset: Test the behavior of the module when the output is sent and verify if it resets to the initial state.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:

**testbench.v**

```verilog
module testbench;

  // Parameters
  parameter CLK_PERIOD = 10; // Clock period in ns

  // Signals
  reg clk;
  reg reset;
  reg a;
  reg b;
  wire o;
  wire [1:0] state;

  // Instantiate ABRO state machine module
  abro_state_machine dut (
    .clk(clk),
    .reset(reset),
    .a(a),
    .b(b),
    .o(o),
    .state(state)
  );

  // Clock generator
  always #((CLK_PERIOD)/2) clk = ~clk;

  // Stimulus generator
  initial begin
    // Test case 1: Initial state
    reset = 1;
    a = 0;
    b = 0;
    #10;
    reset = 0;
    #20;

    // Test case 2: Single input
    reset = 1;
    a = 1;
    b = 0;
    #10;
    reset = 0;
    #20;

    // Test case 3: Both inputs in different order
    reset = 1;
    a = 0;
    b = 1;
    #10;
    reset = 0;
    #20;

    // Test case 4: Multiple inputs
    reset = 1;
    a = 1;
    b = 0;
    #10;
    a = 0;
    b = 1;
    #10;
    a = 1;
    b = 1;
    #10;
    reset = 0;
    #20;

    // Test case 5: Output and reset
    reset = 1;
    a = 1;
    b = 1;
    #10;
    reset = 0;
    #20;
  end

  // Monitor
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    $display("Output: %b, State: %b", o, state);
  end

endmodule
```

This testbench module tests five cases as described above. It instantiates the ABRO state machine module and provides stimulus to its inputs. It also generates the clock signal, monitors the outputs, and displays the output and current state at each clock cycle.
