The necessary blocks for testing the ABRO state machine module are as follows:

1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the ABRO state machine module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs and verify the expected behavior.

2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal required for the ABRO state machine module. It can be a simple module that toggles the clock signal at a specified frequency.

3. Stimulus generator: This block will generate the stimulus for the inputs of the ABRO state machine module. It will provide the necessary inputs such as A, B, and the active-low reset signal in different test cases.

4. Monitor: This block will monitor the outputs of the ABRO state machine module and check if they match the expected behavior.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:

1. Initial state: Test the behavior of the module when it is in the initial state and no inputs have been provided yet.

2. Single input: Test the behavior of the module when only one of the inputs (A or B) is high before the output is sent.

3. Both inputs in different order: Test the behavior of the module when both inputs (A and B) are high, but in a different order than the initial state.

4. Multiple inputs: Test the behavior of the module when both inputs (A and B) are high multiple times before the output is sent.

5. Output and reset: Test the behavior of the module when the output is sent and verify if it resets to the initial state.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:
