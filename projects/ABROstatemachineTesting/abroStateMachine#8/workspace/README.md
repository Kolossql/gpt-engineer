The blocks necessary to properly test the ABRO module are:
1. Testbench module: This module instantiates the ABRO module and provides stimulus to its inputs. It also monitors the outputs and verifies their correctness.
2. Clock generator: This block generates the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This block generates the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Stimulus generator: This block generates the input signals A and B for the testbench module.
5. Monitor: This block monitors the output signals O and State of the ABRO module and checks their correctness.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Testing the initial state where A and B are not entered.
2. Testing the case where A is entered before B.
3. Testing the case where B is entered before A.
4. Testing the case where A and B are entered simultaneously.
5. Testing the case where A and B are entered multiple times in different orders.

Now I will provide the content of the testbench module including all code.
