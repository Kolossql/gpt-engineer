The ABRO state machine has four states: State 00, State 01, State 10, and State 11.\n2. The clock input is used to synchronize the state transitions and output updates of the ABRO state machine.\n3. The active-low reset input is used to reset both A and B inputs, as well as the current state of the machine.\n4. The output state is determined by checking if both A and B inputs have been entered. If both A and B are entered, the output state is reached and the output O is set to 1. Otherwise, the output O remains 0.\n5. The current state of the machine should be outputted as a binary number, where each bit represents the state of the corresponding state in the one-hot encoding.\n6. The one-hot encoding of the states means that each state is represented by a binary number where only one bit is high (1) and all other bits are low (0).\n\nIf everything is sufficiently clear, only answer \"Nothing more to clarify.\"."}]
