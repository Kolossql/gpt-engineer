The ABRO state machine has four states: State 00, State 01, State 10, and State 11.\n2. The clock input is used to synchronize the state transitions and output updates of the ABRO state machine.\n3. The active-low reset input is used to reset both A and B inputs, as well as the current state of the machine.\n4. The output state is determined by checking if both A and B inputs have been entered.
