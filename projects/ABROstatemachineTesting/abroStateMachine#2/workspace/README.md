The necessary blocks for testing the ABRO state machine module are:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the ABRO state machine module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs and verify their correctness.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This block will generate the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Stimulus generator: This block will generate the stimulus for the A and B inputs of the ABRO state machine module.
5. Output monitor: This block will monitor the output of the ABRO state machine module and compare it with the expected output.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Test the behavior of the ABRO state machine when it is in the initial state and no inputs have been entered.
2. Single input: Test the behavior of the ABRO state machine when only one input (A or B) has been entered.
3. Both inputs entered: Test the behavior of the ABRO state machine when both inputs (A and B) have been entered.
4. Reset: Test the behavior of the ABRO state machine when the active-low reset signal is asserted.
5. State transition: Test the behavior of the ABRO state machine when transitioning between different states.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module.
