The blocks necessary to properly test the ABRO module are:
1. ABRO module: The module being tested, which implements the ABRO state machine.
2. Testbench module: A separate module that instantiates the ABRO module and provides stimulus to test its functionality.
3. Clock generator: A module that generates the clock signal for the testbench.
4. Reset generator: A module that generates the active-low reset signal for the testbench.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Testing the initial state where A and B are not entered.
2. Testing the state transition when A is entered before B.
3. Testing the state transition when B is entered before A.
4. Testing the state transition when A and B are entered in the required order.
5. Testing the state transition when A and B are entered in the required order multiple times.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:

**testbench.v**
