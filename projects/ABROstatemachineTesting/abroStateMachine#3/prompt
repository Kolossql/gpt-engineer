I am trying to create a Behavioral Verilog module for an ABRO state machine. It must meet the following specifications:
Initial State: Needs both A and B to be high in any order before the output is sent
Inputs:
Clock: 
Active-low reset: Resets both A and B so that both must be inputted before the output is sent.
A: must be high once before the output is sent
B: must be high once before the output is sent
Outputs: 
O: 1 if the A and B have both been high at least once 0 otherwise
State: binary number corresponding to the current state of the module

When the Output is sent automatically reset the module to its initial state
Other than the main output from ABRO machine, it should output the current state of the machine for use in verification.
