The necessary blocks for testing the ABRO state machine module are as follows:

1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the ABRO state machine module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs and verify their correctness.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:

1. Case 1: A and B are both high before the active-low reset is released.
2. Case 2: A and B are both low before the active-low reset is released.
3. Case 3: A is high before the active-low reset is released, but B remains low.
4. Case 4: B is high before the active-low reset is released, but A remains low.
5. Case 5: A and B transition from low to high after the active-low reset is released.

Now, let's proceed with the content of the testbench module:
