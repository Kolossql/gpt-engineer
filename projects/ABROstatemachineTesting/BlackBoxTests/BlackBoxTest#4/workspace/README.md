Blocks necessary for testing the ABROStateMachine module:
1. Clock generator: To generate the clock signal for the testbench.
2. Stimulus generator: To generate the input stimuli for the ABROStateMachine module.
3. Monitor: To monitor the outputs of the ABROStateMachine module and compare them with expected values.
4. Testbench: The main testbench module that instantiates the ABROStateMachine module and the necessary blocks for testing.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Test the behavior of the module when it is in the initial state.
2. Single input: Test the behavior of the module when only one input (A or B) is high.
3. Both inputs in order: Test the behavior of the module when both inputs (A and B) are high in the correct order.
4. Both inputs in reverse order: Test the behavior of the module when both inputs (A and B) are high in the reverse order.
5. Simultaneous inputs: Test the behavior of the module when both inputs (A and B) are high simultaneously.
