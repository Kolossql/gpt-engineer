Blocks necessary for testing the ABROStateMachine module:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the ABROStateMachine module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also verify the correctness of the outputs.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This block will generate the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Stimulus generator: This block will generate the stimulus for the A and B inputs of the testbench module.
5. Output checker: This block will check the correctness of the O output from the ABROStateMachine module.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Test the module when both A and B inputs are low initially.
2. Single high input: Test the module when only one of the A or B inputs is high.
3. Both inputs high in any order: Test the module when both A and B inputs are high in any order.
4. Continuous high inputs: Test the module when both A and B inputs are continuously high.
5. Reset: Test the module when the reset signal is asserted.
