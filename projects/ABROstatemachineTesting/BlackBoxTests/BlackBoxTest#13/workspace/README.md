Blocks necessary for testing the ABROStateMachine module:
1. Clock generator: To generate the clock signal for the testbench.
2. Stimulus generator: To generate the input stimuli for the ABROStateMachine module.
3. Monitor: To monitor the outputs of the ABROStateMachine module and compare them with expected values.
4. Testbench: The main testbench module that instantiates the ABROStateMachine module and the necessary blocks for testing.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Test when both A and B are low initially and then transition to the state where both A and B are high.
2. Random state: Test when A and B transition randomly between high and low states.
3. Reset: Test the behavior of the module when the reset signal is asserted.
4. Sequential transitions: Test sequential transitions between different states of the ABROStateMachine module.
5. Output verification: Verify that the output O is correctly updated based on the inputs A and B.
