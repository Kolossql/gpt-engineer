Blocks necessary for testing the ABROStateMachine module:
1. Clock generator: To generate the clock signal for the testbench.
2. Stimulus generator: To generate the input stimuli for the ABROStateMachine module.
3. Monitor: To monitor the output of the ABROStateMachine module and compare it with the expected output.
4. Testbench: The main testbench module that instantiates the ABROStateMachine module and the necessary blocks for testing.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Test the behavior of the module when all inputs are low initially.
2. Single occurrence of A and B: Test the behavior of the module when A and B are high only once each.
3. Multiple occurrences of A and B: Test the behavior of the module when A and B are high multiple times.
4. A and B in different order: Test the behavior of the module when A and B are high in different order.
5. Reset: Test the behavior of the module when the reset input is triggered.
