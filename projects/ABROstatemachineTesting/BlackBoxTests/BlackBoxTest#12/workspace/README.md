The necessary blocks for testing the ABROStateMachine module are:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the ABROStateMachine module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also verify the correctness of the outputs by comparing them with expected values.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal required for the ABROStateMachine module.
3. Stimulus generator: This block will generate the stimulus for the inputs of the ABROStateMachine module, including the A and B inputs.
4. Expected output generator: This block will generate the expected values for the outputs of the ABROStateMachine module based on the provided stimulus.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Test the behavior of the module when both A and B are initially low.
2. Single pulse: Test the behavior of the module when A and B are high once in any order.
3. Multiple pulses: Test the behavior of the module when A and B are high multiple times in any order.
4. Reset: Test the behavior of the module when the reset input is activated.
5. Continuous pulses: Test the behavior of the module when A and B are continuously pulsed.

Now, I will provide the content of the testbench module:
