Blocks necessary for testing the ABROStateMachine module:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the ABROStateMachine module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also verify the correctness of the outputs.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate the clock signal for the testbench module.
3. Reset generator: This block will generate the active-low reset signal for the testbench module.
4. Stimulus generator: This block will generate the stimulus for the inputs A and B of the ABROStateMachine module.
5. Output checker: This block will check the correctness of the outputs O and state from the ABROStateMachine module.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Test when both A and B are low initially, and then transition to the state where both A and B are high.
2. Random state: Test with random input combinations of A and B to cover different state transitions.
3. Reset: Test the behavior of the module when the reset signal is asserted.
4. Multiple transitions: Test multiple state transitions to ensure the module behaves correctly in different scenarios.
5. Output verification: Verify the correctness of the output O and state by comparing them with expected values.
