It consists of a state register, state decoder, output logic, and reset logic. The state register stores the current state of the machine, while the state decoder generates the next state based on the current state and input signals. The output logic determines the value of the output O based on the current state, and the reset logic handles the active-low reset functionality. The module also outputs the current state for verification purposes.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
