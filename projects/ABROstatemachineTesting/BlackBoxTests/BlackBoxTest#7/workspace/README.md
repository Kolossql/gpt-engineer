Blocks necessary for testing the ABROStateMachine module:
1. Clock generator: To generate the clock signal for the module.
2. Reset generator: To generate the active-low reset signal for the module.
3. Stimulus generator: To generate the input stimuli for the module.
4. Monitor: To monitor the output of the module and compare it with the expected output.
5. Testbench: The main testbench module that instantiates the ABROStateMachine module and the necessary blocks for testing.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Test the module in its initial state where both A and B inputs are low.
2. Single high input: Test the module with only one of the inputs (A or B) being high.
3. Both inputs high in any order: Test the module with both A and B inputs being high in any order.
4. Both inputs high simultaneously: Test the module with both A and B inputs being high simultaneously.
5. Continuous high inputs: Test the module with continuous high inputs for A and B.
