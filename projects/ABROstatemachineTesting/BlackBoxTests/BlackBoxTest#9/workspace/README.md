The necessary blocks for testing the ABROStateMachine module are:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the ABROStateMachine module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs and verify their correctness.
2. Clock generator: This block will generate a clock signal to drive the clk input of the ABROStateMachine module.
3. Stimulus generator: This block will generate stimulus for the reset, A, and B inputs of the ABROStateMachine module.
4. Monitor: This block will monitor the outputs of the ABROStateMachine module and compare them with the expected values.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Test the behavior of the module when all inputs are low initially.
2. Single input high: Test the behavior of the module when only one of the inputs (A or B) is high.
3. Both inputs high in any order: Test the behavior of the module when both inputs (A and B) are high in any order.
4. Both inputs high simultaneously: Test the behavior of the module when both inputs (A and B) are high simultaneously.
5. Reset behavior: Test the behavior of the module when the reset input is activated.

Now, I will provide the content of the testbench module:
