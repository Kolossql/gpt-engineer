Blocks necessary for testing the ABROStateMachine module:
1. Testbench module: This module will instantiate the ABROStateMachine module and provide stimulus to its inputs. It will also monitor the outputs and compare them with expected values to verify the functionality of the module.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Test the module when all inputs are low initially and ensure that the output remains low until both A and B inputs are high.
2. Single high input: Test the module when only one of the inputs (A or B) is high and ensure that the output remains low until both inputs have been high at least once.
3. Both inputs high in any order: Test the module when both A and B inputs are high in any order and ensure that the output becomes high.
4. Reset behavior: Test the module by asserting the reset input and ensure that it resets the module to its initial state.
5. Continuous input: Test the module with continuous high inputs for A and B and ensure that the output remains high.
