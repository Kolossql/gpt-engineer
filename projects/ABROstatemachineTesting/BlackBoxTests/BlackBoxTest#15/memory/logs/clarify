The clock input is a digital signal that oscillates between a high and a low state. The state machine transitions on the rising edge of the clock.\n2. The active-low reset input, when low, resets the state machine to its initial state, regardless of the current state or the values of inputs A and B.\n3. If inputs A and B are high simultaneously, it is considered as both inputs being high once.\n4. The binary number corresponding to the current state of the module is a two-bit number, where '00' represents the initial state, '01' represents A being high, '10' represents B being high, and '11' represents both A and B being high.\n5. After the output is sent, the module automatically resets to its initial state at the next clock cycle.\n6.
