The blocks necessary to properly test the ABROStateMachine module are:
1. Clock Generator: To generate a clock signal for triggering state transitions.
2. Reset Generator: To generate an active-low reset signal for resetting the module.
3. Stimulus Generator: To generate stimulus for the A and B inputs.
4. Monitor: To monitor the outputs of the ABROStateMachine module and verify their correctness.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Test the module in the initial state where both A and B inputs are low.
2. Transition to state 1: Test the module when A input goes high before B input.
3. Transition to state 2: Test the module when B input goes high before A input.
4. Transition to state 3: Test the module when both A and B inputs go high simultaneously.
5. Output reset: Test the module when the output is sent and the module resets to the initial state.
