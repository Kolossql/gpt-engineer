Core blocks:

1. State Register: This block will hold the current state of the machine. It will be updated on every rising edge of the clock based on the current state and the inputs A and B.

2. Next State Logic: This block will determine the next state of the machine based on the current state and the inputs A and B.

3. Output Logic: This block will generate the output O based on the current state of the machine.

Now, let's write the Verilog code for the ABRO state machine.

abro_state_machine.v
```verilog
module ABROStateMachine (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset_n,
    input wire A,
    input wire B,
    output wire O,
    output wire [1:0] state
);

    // State encoding
    parameter [1:0] S0 = 2'b00; // Initial state
    parameter [1:0] S1 = 2'b01; // A is high
    parameter [1:0] S2 = 2'b10; // B is high
    parameter [1:0] S3 = 2'b11; // Both A and B are high

    // State Register
    reg [1:0] current_state, next_state;

    // Next State Logic
    always @(posedge clk or negedge reset_n) begin
        if (!reset_n)
            current_state <= S0;
        else
            current_state <= next_state;
    end

    // Next State Logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            S0: 
                if (A)
                    next_state = S1;
                else if (B)
                    next_state = S2;
                else
                    next_state = S0;
            S1: 
                if (B)
                    next_state = S3;
                else
                    next_state = S1;
            S2: 
                if (A)
                    next_state = S3;
                else
                    next_state = S2;
            S3: 
                next_state = S0;
            default: 
                next_state = S0;
        endcase
    end

    // Output Logic
    assign O = (current_state == S3) ? 1 : 0;

    // Output current state
    assign state = current_state;

endmodule
```
This Verilog code defines a module for the ABRO state machine. It includes a state register to hold the current state, next state logic to determine the next state based on the current state and inputs, and output logic to generate the output based on the current state. The state machine transitions on the rising edge of the clock, and can be reset to the initial state by an active-low reset signal. The current state of the machine is also outputted for verification purposes.
