Blocks necessary for testing the ABROStateMachine module:
1. Clock generator: To provide a clock signal for the module.
2. Reset generator: To generate the active-low reset signal for the module.
3. Stimulus generator: To generate stimulus for the inputs A and B.
4. Monitor: To monitor the outputs O and State of the module.
5. Testbench: To instantiate the ABROStateMachine module and connect it with the necessary blocks for testing.

Important edge cases to test in the testbench:
1. Initial state: Test the module's behavior when A and B are not high initially.
2. Single high input: Test the module's behavior when only one of A or B goes high.
3. Both inputs high in any order: Test the module's behavior when both A and B go high in any order.
4. Both inputs high simultaneously: Test the module's behavior when both A and B go high simultaneously.
5. Reset: Test the module's behavior when the reset signal is triggered.
