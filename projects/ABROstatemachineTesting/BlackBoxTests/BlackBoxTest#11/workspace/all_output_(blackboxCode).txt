Core Blocks:
1. State Register: This block will store the current state of the ABRO state machine.
2. State Decoder: This block will decode the current state and generate the appropriate outputs.
3. State Transition Logic: This block will determine the next state based on the current state and input signals.
4. Output Logic: This block will determine the value of the output O based on the current state and input signals.

In the above code, the ABROStateMachine module is defined with the specified inputs and outputs. The state register is implemented using an always block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset signal. The state decoder is implemented using another always block that triggers on changes in the state variable. The state transition logic is implemented using an always block that triggers on changes in the state, A, and B inputs. The output logic is implemented within the state decoder always block.

The module follows the 2005 Verilog standard and does not use any SystemVerilog features. It is a single synthesizable module without the use of initial blocks or non-synthesizable functions.
