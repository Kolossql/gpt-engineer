Blocks necessary for testing the ABROStateMachine module:
1. Clock generator: To generate the clock signal for the testbench.
2. Stimulus generator: To generate the input stimuli for the ABROStateMachine module.
3. Monitor: To monitor the outputs of the ABROStateMachine module and compare them with expected values.
4. Testbench: The main testbench module that instantiates the ABROStateMachine module and the necessary blocks for testing.

Important edge cases to test:
1. Initial state: Test when both A and B inputs are low initially.
2. Single high input: Test when only one of the inputs (A or B) is high.
3. Both inputs high in any order: Test when both A and B inputs are high in any order.
4. Both inputs high in order: Test when both A and B inputs are high in a specific order.
5. Reset: Test the behavior of the active-low reset input.
