The state register is implemented using an always block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset signal. The state decoder is implemented using another always block that triggers on changes in the state variable. The state transition logic is implemented using an always block that triggers on changes in the state, A, and B inputs. The output logic is implemented within the state decoder always block.\n\nThe module follows the 2005 Verilog standard and does not use any SystemVerilog features. It is a single synthesizable module without the use of initial blocks or non-synthesizable functions.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
