Blocks necessary for testing the ABROStateMachine module:
1. Clock generator: Generates a clock signal for the testbench.
2. Stimulus generator: Generates stimulus for the inputs of the ABROStateMachine module.
3. Monitor: Monitors the outputs of the ABROStateMachine module and checks if they match the expected outputs.
4. Testbench: The main testbench module that instantiates the ABROStateMachine module and the necessary blocks for testing.

Important edge cases to test:
1. Initial state: Test when both A and B inputs are low initially.
2. Single high input: Test when only one of the A or B inputs is high.
3. Both inputs high in any order: Test when both A and B inputs are high in any order.
4. Both inputs high in order: Test when both A and B inputs are high in a specific order.
5. Reset: Test the behavior of the module when the reset input is triggered.
